2015-07-01 21:46:20	LetoThe2nd	from what I gathered, a manual device node creation is rarely needed nowadays, its the subsystem that should handle this as needed
2015-07-01 21:46:38	LetoThe2nd	(and yes i've read lld3, but i think its outdated in respect to that)
2015-07-01 21:46:47	derRichard	as your driver does not work on a real device you'll have to kick it by hand
2015-07-01 21:47:24	LetoThe2nd	just use the misc subsystem?
2015-07-01 21:47:52	silviof	LetoThe2nd: Sure for the general overview is LDD3 essential (And yes I have read it too, and it is outdated^^)
2015-07-01 21:48:57	LetoThe2nd	silviof: agreed, one should know that in the end this function does the magic. but looking at current driver code, it seems to be misleading - and the examples using it are quite bloated with creating their own class etc too and all that.

2015-07-01 23:07:51	error27	so we could easily add a limit in copy_from_user() and tell everyone else to use copy_from_user_chunked() if they need a huge copy

2015-07-01 23:10:17	luisbg	error27: copy_from_user() returns the amount that was copied, so you just need to check the return and repeat with proper offset
2015-07-01 23:10:24	luisbg	peterz: need help?
2015-07-01 23:11:02	luisbg	peterz: a lot of people in kernel newbies ml and kernel mentors asking for "things to do", helping with reviews would be a good idea IMHO
2015-07-01 23:11:40	peterz	not sure, often it requires to really know a subsystem well before you can judge a patch
2015-07-01 23:12:11	luisbg	right, you would need to doublecheck all positives
2015-07-01 23:12:22	luisbg	but at least you could save some time in the negatives
2015-07-01 23:12:36	luisbg	just an idea :)

2015-07-01 23:20:16	error27	luisbg: my idea is "copy_from_user(dest, src, -1)".  it will overflow the "dest" buffer.  you set up src so you know how much it will corrupt before returning failure.

2015-07-02 05:14:28	SturmFlut	I have a device with a MediaTek MT6582 SoC. The SoC has an internal Boot ROM that's hardwired to a physical address range, and I want to dump it, so I built a kernel with CONFIG_DEVMEM=y and CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM=n, but when trying to read the matching region from /dev/mem using dd, I get a "Bad address" error.

2015-07-02 05:27:38	SturmFlut	nicst: Thanks, I checked that already. I've looked over the kernel source and /proc/iomem, and I think the problem might be that this specific address range is not included in /proc/iomem, so the kernel doesn't want to access it

So it looks like my code is working.  I'll just have to figure out why the register I am interested in is not responding.  Thanks for the confirmation!

2015-07-07 20:07:01	--	bl4ckic3 is now known as unknownidentifier
2015-07-07 20:08:18	unknownidentifier	anybody knows how to read kernel page table without recompiling the kernel?
2015-07-07 20:09:01	derRichard	inject funky code using /dev/mem ;)
2015-07-07 20:09:08	derRichard	depends how far you want to go^^

2015-07-07 20:10:00	unknownidentifier	I am making a LKM to read the Page Table. I am trying to look at the drivers which mapped specific I/O physical memory

2015-07-07 20:10:29	unknownidentifier	application mode apps use mmap() but kernel drivers uses ioremap()
2015-07-07 20:10:29	derRichard	we have already a page table walker in debugfs
2015-07-07 20:10:41	unknownidentifier	yes, yes we do have it is already in the kernel source
2015-07-07 20:10:58	unknownidentifier	however apparently I can not just use that without compiling the kernel
2015-07-07 20:11:13	unknownidentifier	I am using an ARM linux 3.8.15 kernel. 
2015-07-07 20:11:22	derRichard	so what?
2015-07-07 20:11:25	derRichard	rebuild and reboot
2015-07-07 20:11:34	unknownidentifier	Thats exactly what I want to avoid
2015-07-07 20:11:39	derRichard	and why?
2015-07-07 20:11:43	derRichard	this does not make sense
2015-07-07 20:11:48	unknownidentifier	True. 
2015-07-07 20:12:14	unknownidentifier	Because I am trying to make a malicious LKM driver for my university project. 
2015-07-07 20:12:30	derRichard	you are on your own
2015-07-07 20:12:32	unknownidentifier	If the malicious code have to recompile the kernel to check page table it does not make sense either!
2015-07-07 20:13:00	unknownidentifier	Why?
2015-07-07 20:13:12	derRichard	i don't support malware writers
2015-07-07 20:13:35	LetoThe2nd	unknownidentifier: people on irc usually do not help on questions that are clearly targeting exploits or 
2015-07-07 20:13:38	LetoThe2nd	malware.
2015-07-07 20:13:56	LetoThe2nd	unknownidentifier: so if its really an university project, it makes way more sense to figure it out yourself.
2015-07-07 20:14:01	unknownidentifier	Excuse me I am not a malware writer, I am developing a proof of concept code to show the weaknesses I already made it for user mode memory mapping of IO

2015-07-07 20:16:12	LetoThe2nd	*shrug*
2015-07-07 20:16:33	LetoThe2nd	isn't "inject funky code through dev/mem" hint enough?
2015-07-07 20:17:24	LetoThe2nd	plus, university addresses are cheap and students are not really known to be amongst the most trustworthy people to hand potentially malicious code
2015-07-07 20:17:33	LetoThe2nd	(read: you're really not getting out of this)
2015-07-07 20:17:56	unknownidentifier	@LetoThe2nd, I will try to figure out what you said. Thanks.

2015-12-13 02:51:10	glycoknob	it's reproducible on load on current 4.2, 4.3.0 and IIRC 4.1.7 
2015-12-13 02:51:26	glycoknob	applications crashes with SIGSEV and this appears in the logfile
2015-12-13 02:51:49	glycoknob	dell poweredge 720 - 2x6core xeon e5 - numa, 64gb ram
2015-12-13 02:52:05	glycoknob	what can I do to pinpoint the problem? 
2015-12-13 02:52:15	valdis	https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/1/22/602 - appears to have been around for a while now?
2015-12-13 02:53:20	valdis	Yow.  Found a reference to 3.4-rc hitting that..
2015-12-13 02:53:28	glycoknob	valdis: I'm kind of a noob regarding the kernel, this commit looks related but it's in all kernel that trigger the bug
2015-12-13 02:54:47	valdis	As I said, a quick search shows that it's been triggerable for several years.
2015-12-13 02:54:55	glycoknob	@valdis: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/11/6/733
2015-12-13 02:55:22	glycoknob	I tried to disable transparent hugepages, however I've not rebooted the machines. Is this related? 
2015-12-13 02:56:16	glycoknob	valdis: from my noobish understand the message indicates corruptions on memory structures, so it's likely that it appears in a lot of places? 
2015-12-13 02:56:22	valdis	Hard to tell.  Probably multiple ways to trigger it.  If hugepages is a way, you'll probably want to boot with it disabled.
2015-12-13 02:56:43	glycoknob	valdis: so directly on the kernel cmdline? is setting it on boot via sysfs too late? 
2015-12-13 02:57:27	valdis	That commit landed in 4.3-rc7.  So if it broke on 4.1.7 and on 4.3.0, it isn'[t the cause or fix for it (as you have breakage with and without that commit in)
2015-12-13 02:57:32	glycoknob	if you need data, it's a cluster that triggers the bug more or less reproducable on at least one machine if a job runs
2015-12-13 02:58:10	glycoknob	valdis: yes. I've looked into all changelogs and the commit is already in place in all kernels that are triggering it
2015-12-13 02:58:42	glycoknob	it's not soo nice if random jobs get killed :/ 
2015-12-13 02:59:10	valdis	Oh, so gregkh did get it into 4.1.stable?
2015-12-13 02:59:24	glycoknob	valdis: the commit is also in 4.1 stable
2015-12-13 02:59:58	glycoknob	but the problem also appeared before the commit 
2015-12-13 03:00:07	glycoknob	on 4.2.0 
2015-12-13 03:00:07	valdis	Though looking at it, it *closes* one way the issue can happen.  So you're probably looking for another cause.
2015-12-13 03:00:50	glycoknob	valdis: Can I turn on some knobs that help the developers to pinpoint it? e.g. backtraces or something like that? 
2015-12-13 03:01:34	<--	Jesin (~Jesin@pool-108-48-131-2.washdc.east.verizon.net) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2015-12-13 03:02:04	valdis	Well, other than the backtrace the BUG produced, nothing obvious.  If you're able to build/boot your own kernel, I'd turn on everything in sight under 'Kernel Debugging' in make menuconfig and pray that a debugging check catches the issue closer to the root cause...
2015-12-13 03:03:06	glycoknob	valdis: funnily enough.. there is no backtrace for this bug - however should adding debug to the kernel cmdline would help? 
2015-12-13 03:04:32	valdis	Umm.. if your kernel BUG''ed and didn't produce a backtrace, something is wrong...
2015-12-13 03:05:15	valdis	Might want to turn on netconsole to another box or something, see if the issue is that after the BUG, your syslog daemon becomes wedged.

2015-12-13 03:06:12	glycoknob	valdis: the system is stable after the bug appears.. just some hadoop daemons crash randomly due to it
2015-12-13 03:08:58	glycoknob	valdis: e.g. I can trigger stuff via sysreq and it appears fine

2015-12-13 03:25:38	glycoknob	valdis: can you clarify? pr_alert() should trigger a backtrace? 
2015-12-13 03:25:47	glycoknob	another funny thing: 
2015-12-13 03:25:59	glycoknob	app crashes 5-10 minutes before the line appears in dmesg
2015-12-13 03:26:26	glycoknob	but we have 135 servers (ecc memory) and it's always the same behavoir
2015-12-13 03:26:51	glycoknob	so I can provide jvm crashlogs 
2015-12-13 03:27:01	valdis	glycoknob: The 5-10 minutes isn't surprising.  App crashes, leaves crap in an inconsistent state - which then gets tripped over at a later time.
2015-12-13 03:29:37	glycoknob	valdis: okay, so i try a clean reboot the thp disabled - is it okay to write this up and send a mail to the mm-mailing list?

2015-12-13 03:32:43	glycoknob	valdis: well I'm a student assistant at a university, we can reproduce the crash if someone want's to look into it, I guess we can arrange something. At the moment our hadoop cluster is unusable due to this bug. We need to run recent kernels due to btrfs (don't ask, was not my decision) 
2015-12-13 03:33:42	glycoknob	I'm willing to give ssh access or provide any data if we can get rid of this stupid bug
2015-12-13 03:34:30	valdis	More likely, you'll be asked to build a kernel with some debugging/instrumentation turned on.
2015-12-13 03:35:18	glycoknob	valdis: can I use the ubuntu kernel with debug flags turned on? I guess it's not a problem, we pxe boot all machines however if the performance is like 100x worse it's a problem.

2015-12-13 03:41:44	valdis	'make menuconfig', look under 'kernel hacking' for stuff labeled 'debug' :)
2015-12-13 03:44:02	TheJH	why does the deb-pkg target always clean and rebuild everything?
2015-12-13 03:44:23	TheJH	when I use it to recompile the kernel when testing things, it is annoying and hides warnings from me
2015-12-13 03:44:40	valdis	TheJH: then don't use deb-pkg for testing. :)
2015-12-13 03:45:05	TheJH	valdis: ugh. but then I have to mess with the grub config, right?
2015-12-13 03:47:26	valdis	TheJH: Well, depends.  If you have a 'installkernel' command, 'make install' will do all that for you.
2015-12-13 03:48:07	valdis	rel=`make kernelrelease`
2015-12-13 03:48:07	valdis	echo Installing kernel ${rel}
2015-12-13 03:48:07	valdis	set -x
2015-12-13 03:48:07	valdis	make modules_install
2015-12-13 03:48:07	valdis	cp System.map /boot/System.map-${rel}
2015-12-13 03:48:08	valdis	cp .config /boot/config-${rel}
2015-12-13 03:48:08	valdis	/usr/bin/dracut --xz -f -H --no-kernel -o "busybox qemu btrfs resume kernel-modules dmraid multipath" /boot/initramfs-${rel}.img ${rel}
2015-12-13 03:48:10	valdis	cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-${rel}
2015-12-13 03:48:10	valdis	grubby --add-kernel=/boot/vmlinuz-${rel} --initrd=/boot/initramfs-${rel}.img --title=${rel} --make-default --copy-default
2015-12-13 03:48:11	TheJH	ah, in "debiantools"
2015-12-13 03:48:13	valdis	That;s mine.
2015-12-13 03:48:32	TheJH	seems like debian ships with one
2015-12-13 03:48:33	valdis	And it can even be simpler.
2015-12-13 03:48:51	TheJH	er, "debianutils"
2015-12-13 03:49:54	valdis	If it does a 'make modules_install', copies the kernel, builds a new initrd, and updates grub/whatever, that's all that;'s needed.  Copying over System.map and .config are gravy.
2015-12-13 03:50:54	TheJH	nice, it runs everything in /etc/kernel/postinst.d on the new kernel. with update-grub, initramfs-tools and a bunch of other things
2015-12-13 03:51:52	TheJH	so, "make -j8 && sudo make install"? to avoid having root-owned generated files in the kernel tree?
2015-12-13 04:03:25	TheJH	yup, that worked. thanks!

2015-12-13 21:15:08	diego	let me try to do that
2015-12-13 21:16:45	derRichard	also think of the target audience
2015-12-13 21:17:01	derRichard	joy random user will just use the distro way of installing a new kernel

2015-12-13 21:18:34	diego	yeah
2015-12-13 21:19:25	diego	lol
2015-12-13 21:20:56	derRichard	"Refer to your bootloader documentation for configuration details." is useless
2015-12-13 21:21:03	derRichard	kernel hackers know that we have grub, lilo and friends
2015-12-13 21:21:25	derRichard	you could provide some examples, how to use them. especially gummiboot is less known
2015-12-13 21:21:32	derRichard	and don't focus only on x86
2015-12-13 21:22:30	diego	derRichard: the problem is, I can mention GRUB, systemd-boot, syslinux, gummiboot, etc. but if I mention how to configure each, the README file will be huge
2015-12-13 21:23:23	diego	so I can list the configuration for each, or I can be more vague
2015-12-13 21:23:44	diego	or refer only to GRUB or lilo
2015-12-13 21:23:53	diego	not sure what I can do here

2015-12-13 21:25:12	diego	derRichard: I wanted to make it as agnostic as possible, but I see some people won't like that
2015-12-13 21:26:11	diego	what do you suggest?
2015-12-13 21:27:01	derRichard	you want to change/fix/improve/whatever the README

2015-12-20 15:34:12	alhunt	I understand that when submitting patches each patch should fix one thing. What do you do when your patch doesn't fix all checkpatch errors on a line you've modified? So checkpatch will throw a check for the patch your submitting.

2015-12-20 15:40:17	vishal	alhunt: you could take the chance to fix the checkpatch error also, and make a note of it in the commit message
2015-12-20 15:40:51	vishal	since you're already touching the line, additional changes aren't a big deal
2015-12-20 15:42:37	alhunt	The problem is the patch is just a simple one to remove unnecessary parentheses but the checkpatch check is about camelcase
2015-12-20 15:44:45	alhunt	changing the camelcase variable to lower would mean changing multiple other lines

2015-12-20 15:49:39	vbabka	alhunt: is the parentheses patch worth it anyway?
2015-12-20 15:51:48	vbabka	they might be there to make the code clearer to humans, even though compiler doesn't care
2015-12-20 15:52:16	alhunt	vbabka: I've never contributed before so this was more an exercise on understanding the submission process rather than a dying need to fix up checkpatch issues.
2015-12-20 15:53:26	vbabka	ok, please keep avoiding such need :P
2015-12-20 15:53:39	alhunt	Perhaps I'll take a step back and find something more straight forward.
2015-12-20 15:55:20	alhunt	I'm also looking at cheap wifi nics that use rtl8188eu so I can try and make a more useful contribution.
