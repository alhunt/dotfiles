The generic USBHID driver picks up the pad, not the specialized driver. I tried the kernel patch listed here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBook#Touchpad_2 with no luck. Other people say that it's working for them (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=96771), but it doesn't work for me. Any help?

2015-07-02 22:51:32	Amm0n	pid1, If you set uMatrix to deny-all, allow manually mode and block the 1-st party section globally, it should block content like NoScript does. However, it appears that whitelisting a domain in uMatrix will make you vulnerable to XSS attacks on that domain. NoScript will protect you against XSS even if the domain is whitelisted. If you are not worried about XSS then it’s OK to use uMatrix with deny by default mode. http://blog.add0n.com/2015/05/16/

2015-07-02 23:30:39	tflgen2	hi, this is more of a general question in linux, but I'm wondering if there exists a program that can open urls from a log file on the fly. I'm trying to monitor my home network. I do have URLs already being parsed from this file, and was thinking of how driftnet works, but that's on a network capture

2015-07-02 23:32:51	tflgen2	as they are written to the log
2015-07-02 23:33:04	tomty89	hmm copy-on-select?
2015-07-02 23:33:05	grawity	seemikehack: X has two separate buffers, the "primary selection" and the "clipboard"
2015-07-02 23:33:15	N0BOX	tflgen2: are you wanting the pictures to just pop up in firefox tabs as they are logged or something?
2015-07-02 23:33:27	grawity	seemikehack: usually when you select stuff it only goes to the "primary" buffer, and does not affect what you Ctrl+C'd or Edit→Copy'd
2015-07-02 23:33:40	grawity	seemikehack: so I'd say, just ignore it
2015-07-02 23:33:47	tflgen2	N0BOX: tabs would be a bit unwieldy, I'd rather a scrolling window

2015-07-02 23:34:12	grawity	seemikehack: if it actually overwrites the "clipboard", however, then it's something done by a program you have running (like parcellite or loliclip or autocutsel or whatever)
2015-07-02 23:34:22	seemikehack	grawity, when I select and then Ctrl+V, I get what's in the primary selection though, not what's in the clipboard.

During Arch install both the external monitors were active and then LVDS about 3 minutes later turns on. Post install both externals are active but LVDS never activate. The external monitors are showing 1366x768 pixels leading me to believe "LVDS" is somehow active but blank. http://i.imgur.com/skJfdqZ.jpg After starting X, All three seem to be active 
2015-07-03 02:58:58	ParkerR	but HDMI is the only thing showing a picture. dmesg prints some weird errors at the end.

2015-12-11 20:26:54	Achillion	What's the best (or a good) way to handle installing packages that require protobuf3 when we want to keep protobuf(2) packages as well? I've had this issue for a while and I resorted to keeping protobuf3 around only and installing (compiling) the -git version of packages that require protobuf. As I understand it, repo packages are built against pb2. It becomes a bit of a mess though to be running that many
2015-12-11 20:26:56	Achillion	-git packages and I just came across a case where the -git package fails to build (mumble-git). Surely there's a better way.

It does seem overly complicated - but in practice, for packages that move decently quickly, to stay up to date it's very tedious to go through and `git pull`, `./configure` `make` `make install`, etc - and the other thing, makepkg obfuscates the build system (via the pkgbuild) so that you have to do exactly `makepkg -i` to download changes, build, and install

2015-12-20 16:42:30	zerol0g1k	but its there. works for everyone else

2015-12-20 16:43:33	zerol0g1k	dvorak is just another keymap and is not special as far as the operating system is concerned
2015-12-20 16:43:35	zerol0g1k	its only special to you
2015-12-20 16:43:44	AfterDarkness	parazyd, how do I make sure that arch won't touch the already existing boot partition, when I am installing arch?
2015-12-20 16:43:56	Ipsilon	AfterDarkness: you just skip the arch step where you install a boot manager, and then you update ubuntu's 
2015-12-20 16:43:56	m0kc	it's also doing strange things like, it's uses dv in terminal (after I set it), but keyboard shortcuts , like to get to dmenu, or still set in qwerty
2015-12-20 16:44:02	DinCahill	yup
2015-12-20 16:44:06	parazyd	AfterDarkness: it won't touch it if you don't run grub commands

2015-12-20 16:45:33	zerol0g1k	m0kc: that sounds more like i3 is simply ignoring the setting. thats a different matter. 
2015-12-20 16:45:34	parazyd	if you wish, you can use the same /home partition for both arch and ubuntu. the switch should be painless then
2015-12-20 16:45:35	Ipsilon	arch is not a magically better performer than ubuntu. You still need to understand what you are doing to avoid bloating an installation
2015-12-20 16:45:48	zerol0g1k	^
2015-12-20 16:46:02	AfterDarkness	parazyd, the problem is I didnt make a home partition when I installed ubuntu
2015-12-20 16:46:16	parazyd	oh :D
2015-12-20 16:46:36	Ipsilon	sharing a /home partition is not that great of an idea unless you really need to. dotfiles can be incompatible in certain applications

2015-12-20 17:51:19	Rasi	thats bullshit

2015-12-20 17:52:15	Rasi	perfect benchmark
2015-12-20 17:52:18	Rasi	and totally useless
2015-12-20 17:52:36	Rasi	measuring memory usage in linux is close to impossible
2015-12-20 17:52:42	Kamran	how so?
2015-12-20 17:52:43	marsmensch	Ipsilon, thats why i wondered. i remember reading the i3 dev specifically rejecting implementing stacking features
2015-12-20 17:52:45	Rasi	esp. when you want to measure multiple processes
2015-12-20 17:52:51	Kamran	Rasi: How so?
2015-12-20 17:52:52	marsmensch	since he wanted to keep it primarily tiling
2015-12-20 17:52:55	nichego	Kamran: you should disable mpd's internal resampler and use something else. you also should take into account mpd does a million more things than cmus. the difference is there, not in mpd's client-server architecture
2015-12-20 17:53:03	Ipsilon	marsmensch: well, it still works

2015-12-20 18:11:15	BrainDamage	also, if your yoghurt smells, you should try to eat things regularry rather than let rot in the fridge for months
2015-12-20 18:11:28	nichego	Tom^: if he's using the aur recipe it's older than ffmpeg in the repo and it takes a long time to compile each time

2015-12-20 18:12:01	Tom^	so why would that be older then the repo
2015-12-20 18:12:03	Tom^	are you mad?

2015-12-20 18:16:23	BrainDamage	if you're a dev, you don't generally want to package your dev build and use it system wide
2015-12-20 18:16:29	nichego	that's bad cost-benefit analysis :(
2015-12-20 18:16:32	Ipsilon	there are reasons for *-git compilations. But usually people who use them have even a single reason to
2015-12-20 18:16:35	Ipsilon	but who knows
2015-12-20 18:16:36	MrElendig	it's not great for conics though
2015-12-20 18:16:54	BrainDamage	at least, back when i was writing a program that was also packaged, i kept the stable installed  system wide, and the dev in a folder
2015-12-20 18:16:55	Kamran	But if anybody thinks I'm using the -git version of gcc they're crazy
2015-12-20 18:17:06	Kamran	That shit takes FOREVER to compile

2015-12-20 18:21:13	Rasi	which ncmpcpp can then read
2015-12-20 18:21:36	nichego	perhaps he should check. i recall a hack on windows to force ps to use opengl accel even on "unsupported" cards

2016-11-26 20:49:02	zeeb_	you usually have to go to Kwin settings and set a keyboard command. that keyboard shortcut grabs a command from somewhere.

2016-11-27 10:10:01	Hello71	with great difficulty.
2016-11-27 10:10:20	phatlipp	Well I'm going to stick with MuQSS because it feels faster
2016-11-27 10:10:33	phatlipp	it might not BE faster, but it FEELS faster

2016-11-27 10:10:38	strayArch	sheep, at work. it wasn't in the actual configuration file, but the tables that displayed info on ports/services used that notation. Considering someone in #networking new what it meant, I'm guessing it's somewhat common for networking peeps. Although, I never saw it before this job...

2016-11-27 10:18:04	strayArch	sheep, it's a common way to convey port/services info from source to destination --- people use the notation, not specific to a program.

2016-11-27 10:23:36	JZA	I klnow I could just add it to a bash variable, but not sure whats the best way.
2016-11-27 10:23:36	sheep	what kind of alias? a hostname, or another IP?
2016-11-27 10:23:36	phatlipp	JZA you can use /etc/hosts
2016-11-27 10:23:36	phatlipp	if you want a hostname
