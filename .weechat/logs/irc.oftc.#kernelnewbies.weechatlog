2015-07-01 21:46:20	LetoThe2nd	from what I gathered, a manual device node creation is rarely needed nowadays, its the subsystem that should handle this as needed
2015-07-01 21:46:38	LetoThe2nd	(and yes i've read lld3, but i think its outdated in respect to that)
2015-07-01 21:46:47	derRichard	as your driver does not work on a real device you'll have to kick it by hand
2015-07-01 21:47:24	LetoThe2nd	just use the misc subsystem?
2015-07-01 21:47:52	silviof	LetoThe2nd: Sure for the general overview is LDD3 essential (And yes I have read it too, and it is outdated^^)
2015-07-01 21:48:57	LetoThe2nd	silviof: agreed, one should know that in the end this function does the magic. but looking at current driver code, it seems to be misleading - and the examples using it are quite bloated with creating their own class etc too and all that.

2015-07-01 23:07:51	error27	so we could easily add a limit in copy_from_user() and tell everyone else to use copy_from_user_chunked() if they need a huge copy

2015-07-01 23:10:17	luisbg	error27: copy_from_user() returns the amount that was copied, so you just need to check the return and repeat with proper offset
2015-07-01 23:10:24	luisbg	peterz: need help?
2015-07-01 23:11:02	luisbg	peterz: a lot of people in kernel newbies ml and kernel mentors asking for "things to do", helping with reviews would be a good idea IMHO
2015-07-01 23:11:40	peterz	not sure, often it requires to really know a subsystem well before you can judge a patch
2015-07-01 23:12:11	luisbg	right, you would need to doublecheck all positives
2015-07-01 23:12:22	luisbg	but at least you could save some time in the negatives
2015-07-01 23:12:36	luisbg	just an idea :)

2015-07-01 23:20:16	error27	luisbg: my idea is "copy_from_user(dest, src, -1)".  it will overflow the "dest" buffer.  you set up src so you know how much it will corrupt before returning failure.

2015-07-02 05:14:28	SturmFlut	I have a device with a MediaTek MT6582 SoC. The SoC has an internal Boot ROM that's hardwired to a physical address range, and I want to dump it, so I built a kernel with CONFIG_DEVMEM=y and CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM=n, but when trying to read the matching region from /dev/mem using dd, I get a "Bad address" error.

2015-07-02 05:27:38	SturmFlut	nicst: Thanks, I checked that already. I've looked over the kernel source and /proc/iomem, and I think the problem might be that this specific address range is not included in /proc/iomem, so the kernel doesn't want to access it

2015-07-03 06:37:44	slashnull	Yes, I just blasted a bunch of 0xFFFFFFFF to a pci device I was monitoring in /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.0/resource0 and saw that some of the registers changed (and crashed the card of course).  So it looks like my code is working.  I'll just have to figure out why the register I am interested in is not responding.  Thanks for the confirmation!

2015-07-07 20:07:01	--	bl4ckic3 is now known as unknownidentifier
2015-07-07 20:08:18	unknownidentifier	anybody knows how to read kernel page table without recompiling the kernel?
2015-07-07 20:09:01	derRichard	inject funky code using /dev/mem ;)
2015-07-07 20:09:08	derRichard	depends how far you want to go^^

2015-07-07 20:10:00	unknownidentifier	I am making a LKM to read the Page Table. I am trying to look at the drivers which mapped specific I/O physical memory

2015-07-07 20:10:29	unknownidentifier	application mode apps use mmap() but kernel drivers uses ioremap()
2015-07-07 20:10:29	derRichard	we have already a page table walker in debugfs
2015-07-07 20:10:41	unknownidentifier	yes, yes we do have it is already in the kernel source
2015-07-07 20:10:58	unknownidentifier	however apparently I can not just use that without compiling the kernel
2015-07-07 20:11:13	unknownidentifier	I am using an ARM linux 3.8.15 kernel. 
2015-07-07 20:11:22	derRichard	so what?
2015-07-07 20:11:25	derRichard	rebuild and reboot
2015-07-07 20:11:34	unknownidentifier	Thats exactly what I want to avoid
2015-07-07 20:11:39	derRichard	and why?
2015-07-07 20:11:43	derRichard	this does not make sense
2015-07-07 20:11:48	unknownidentifier	True. 
2015-07-07 20:12:14	unknownidentifier	Because I am trying to make a malicious LKM driver for my university project. 
2015-07-07 20:12:30	derRichard	you are on your own
2015-07-07 20:12:32	unknownidentifier	If the malicious code have to recompile the kernel to check page table it does not make sense either!
2015-07-07 20:13:00	unknownidentifier	Why?
2015-07-07 20:13:12	derRichard	i don't support malware writers
2015-07-07 20:13:35	LetoThe2nd	unknownidentifier: people on irc usually do not help on questions that are clearly targeting exploits or 
2015-07-07 20:13:38	LetoThe2nd	malware.
2015-07-07 20:13:56	LetoThe2nd	unknownidentifier: so if its really an university project, it makes way more sense to figure it out yourself.
2015-07-07 20:14:01	unknownidentifier	Excuse me I am not a malware writer, I am developing a proof of concept code to show the weaknesses I already made it for user mode memory mapping of IO

2015-07-07 20:16:12	LetoThe2nd	*shrug*
2015-07-07 20:16:33	LetoThe2nd	isn't "inject funky code through dev/mem" hint enough?
2015-07-07 20:17:24	LetoThe2nd	plus, university addresses are cheap and students are not really known to be amongst the most trustworthy people to hand potentially malicious code
2015-07-07 20:17:33	LetoThe2nd	(read: you're really not getting out of this)
2015-07-07 20:17:56	unknownidentifier	@LetoThe2nd, I will try to figure out what you said. Thanks.
