2015-07-02 03:26:31	ThatTreeOverTher	I've installed Arch on my MacBook Pro (12,1) and the touchpad doesn't register right/middle clicks. The generic USBHID driver picks up the pad, not the specialized driver. I tried the kernel patch listed here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBook#Touchpad_2 with no luck. Other people say that it's working for them (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=96771), but it doesn't work for me. Any help?

2015-07-02 22:51:32	Amm0n	pid1, If you set uMatrix to deny-all, allow manually mode and block the 1-st party section globally, it should block content like NoScript does. However, it appears that whitelisting a domain in uMatrix will make you vulnerable to XSS attacks on that domain. NoScript will protect you against XSS even if the domain is whitelisted. If you are not worried about XSS then it’s OK to use uMatrix with deny by default mode. http://blog.add0n.com/2015/05/16/

2015-07-02 23:30:39	tflgen2	hi, this is more of a general question in linux, but I'm wondering if there exists a program that can open urls from a log file on the fly. I'm trying to monitor my home network. I do have URLs already being parsed from this file, and was thinking of how driftnet works, but that's on a network capture

2015-07-02 23:32:51	tflgen2	as they are written to the log
2015-07-02 23:33:04	tomty89	hmm copy-on-select?
2015-07-02 23:33:05	grawity	seemikehack: X has two separate buffers, the "primary selection" and the "clipboard"
2015-07-02 23:33:15	N0BOX	tflgen2: are you wanting the pictures to just pop up in firefox tabs as they are logged or something?
2015-07-02 23:33:27	grawity	seemikehack: usually when you select stuff it only goes to the "primary" buffer, and does not affect what you Ctrl+C'd or Edit→Copy'd
2015-07-02 23:33:40	grawity	seemikehack: so I'd say, just ignore it
2015-07-02 23:33:47	tflgen2	N0BOX: tabs would be a bit unwieldy, I'd rather a scrolling window

2015-07-02 23:34:12	grawity	seemikehack: if it actually overwrites the "clipboard", however, then it's something done by a program you have running (like parcellite or loliclip or autocutsel or whatever)
2015-07-02 23:34:22	seemikehack	grawity, when I select and then Ctrl+V, I get what's in the primary selection though, not what's in the clipboard.

2015-07-02 23:35:13	N0BOX	tflgen2: that would require something like a web server and a php/python script that serves as an AJAX backend for a local web page that automatically pulls in any new images as they are logged

During Arch install both the external monitors were active and then LVDS about 3 minutes later turns on. Post install both externals are active but LVDS never activate. The external monitors are showing 1366x768 pixels leading me to believe "LVDS" is somehow active but blank. http://i.imgur.com/skJfdqZ.jpg After starting X, All three seem to be active 
2015-07-03 02:58:58	ParkerR	but HDMI is the only thing showing a picture. dmesg prints some weird errors at the end.
