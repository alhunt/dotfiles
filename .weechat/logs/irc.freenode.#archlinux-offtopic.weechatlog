2015-07-02 02:59:44	Celti	Because if you've never been there you're not allowed to have an opinion about the things they're doing that you dislike, obviously! :-p

2015-07-02 03:02:00	TheNumb	*would
2015-07-02 03:02:04	Crashlog	Because it sounds like poutine
2015-07-02 03:02:05	Celti	I'd totally eat Putin. Mmmm, the sweetness of a Soviet dictator...

2015-07-02 03:02:37	Celti	poutine is delicious
2015-07-02 03:02:40	voidead	Putin eats bears.. so probably plenty of protein
2015-07-02 03:03:06	Celti	it's nigh-impossible to find real cheese curds to make it out here in the desert, though
2015-07-02 03:03:21	voidead	Celti: desert?
2015-07-02 03:03:32	 *	Celti lives in the Sonoran Desert.
2015-07-02 03:03:35	oats	I once got to eat fresh cheese curds while in wisconsin
2015-07-02 03:03:39	oats	they're fantastic
2015-07-02 03:03:52	krosos	i find "nation birthdays" very weird and they creep me out, no matter which country. even more slaughter-of-natives eh sorry columbus-day and similar days
2015-07-02 03:03:53	oats	squeaky creamy deliciousness
2015-07-02 03:03:54	voidead	not sure if I would ever live in a desert
2015-07-02 03:03:58	Celti	oats: Indeed.
2015-07-02 03:04:27	ekkelett	Crashlog: Swedish?
2015-07-02 03:04:27	Celti	voidead: I grew up here, so... it's not bad, but I want to move to the Pacific Northwest or somewhere else where I can avoid ever seeing the sun again.
2015-07-02 03:04:46	Crashlog	ekkelett, nope. Finnish. Why?
2015-07-02 03:04:51	oats	Celti: how 'bout britian? :D

2015-07-02 03:05:14	Celti	voidead: No, in northern Alaska the sun is up for half the year!
2015-07-02 03:05:14	voidead	they have a long darkness
2015-07-02 03:05:34	voidead	half dark too
2015-07-02 03:05:56	Crashlog	Call up McMurdo and ask if they'll take you on as free labour
2015-07-02 03:06:00	Celti	Obviously I have to have a migratory pattern, following the darkness from the Arctic Circle to the Antarctic.
2015-07-02 03:06:06	voidead	Celti: just cover your windows
2015-07-02 03:06:07	oats	I can't help but wonder what it'd be like to live in a place like deadhorse, ak
2015-07-02 03:06:20	Celti	voidead: And never leave my house?
2015-07-02 03:06:23	ekkelett	Crashlog: ah, that makes sense. You share the same typical nordic layouts as Norwegians, Swedes and Danes do, don't you?
2015-07-02 03:06:43	voidead	Celti: why worry
2015-07-02 03:06:45	ekkelett	Crashlog: also, obligatory "perkele!"
2015-07-02 03:06:48	ekkelett	:D
2015-07-02 03:06:48	krosos	what layouts
2015-07-02 03:06:57	ekkelett	krosos: the keyboard kind
2015-07-02 03:07:00	oats	krosos: I assume they're talking about keyboard layouts
2015-07-02 03:07:01	krosos	oh
2015-07-02 03:07:06	voidead	just cover up when at home
2015-07-02 03:07:30	Crashlog	ekkelett, I'm pretty sure it's the same layout for all of us since manufacturers always call it a nordic layout
2015-07-02 03:07:36	Celti	other reasons to hate the desert: today is unnaturally cool at a low low 40°C.
2015-07-02 03:07:44	ekkelett	Crashlog: that's what I'm assuming
2015-07-02 03:07:54	ekkelett	Celti: that's just awfully cold.
2015-07-02 03:08:01	Crashlog	Celti, better cover up then so you don't freeze to death
2015-07-02 03:08:09	voidead	Celti: I hate cold weather though
2015-07-02 03:08:19	Crashlog	Don't deserts get really cold during the night?
2015-07-02 03:08:23	krosos	low as in 40°C? where do you live?
2015-07-02 03:09:08	Celti	Crashlog: They do when you don't build 20,000 sq. km of city in them.
2015-07-02 03:09:17	Celti	krosos: Phoenix, Arizona, USA.
2015-07-02 03:09:20	krosos	oh
2015-07-02 03:09:55	Crashlog	Oh. I hear the pavement melts the soles of your shoes off during the day down around those parts. RIP in peace
2015-07-02 03:09:55	Celti	The temperature basically won't drop below 30°C all summer, even at night.
2015-07-02 03:10:20	Celti	Crashlog: Yeah, if you're not careful about what shoes you buy they will melt
2015-07-02 03:10:33	Celti	The pavement can get hot enough to literally fry an egg
2015-07-02 03:10:36	MrVandelay	Anyone using urxvt-vtwheel? It seems to not be working
2015-07-02 03:10:47	Celti	there's also one guy I know that bakes cookies in his car every summer

2015-07-02 03:15:38	MrVandelay	Not usually
2015-07-02 03:15:44	Celti	It won't load the new extensions if you don't.
2015-07-02 03:15:48	MrVandelay	I'll just try starting a regular urxvt process and see if that works
2015-07-02 03:16:19	MrVandelay	Celti: That has probably changed, because it does now

2015-07-02 03:29:13	dunz0r	Apart from the really stupid logging, now that I've used systemd for a while, it's not that bad
2015-07-02 03:29:26	dunz0r	But I really hate the binary logging and convoluted interface with silly levels and shit.
2015-07-02 03:29:40	ekkelett	While it's binary, I love the easy filtering it gives along with the metadata.

2015-07-02 04:01:30	ekkelett	Why not download a higher quality 720p scene release or similarly, krosos?
2015-07-02 04:01:36	Crashlog	Always go for the 30GB BD rips
2015-07-02 04:01:40	archfan	ALWAYS
2015-07-02 04:01:45	Crashlog	Literally always
2015-07-02 04:01:52	krosos	eh because the uncut version was only released on dvd o-O

2015-07-02 04:04:35	dunz0r	I always go with the 8-10GB 1080p, that's enough for me
2015-07-02 04:04:43	dunz0r	God damn p2p-shit axxo.
2015-07-02 04:04:57	Crashlog	The least they could do is take the DVD, rip the content, burn it to a BD and then rip that. Boom, quality upgraded
2015-07-02 04:05:18	dunz0r	No, upscaled...
2015-07-02 04:05:19	archfan	indeed
2015-07-02 04:05:37	ekkelett	It's not like Crashlog was joking or anything.
2015-07-02 04:05:44	ekkelett	Certainly he was deadly serious in what he said. :p
2015-07-02 04:05:54	krosos	fyi, the original master of dark star is lost, which is why everything sold as dark star these days looks like shit. and not every movie on bluray looks better

2015-07-02 04:28:10	Crashlog	The conclusion is that there are no good programming languages

2015-07-02 04:31:10	Crashlog	My programming knowledge is limited to Python and Java, and is _very_ limited at that. I couldn't really tell you what's wrong with any of them from my personal experience. That said, the most common complaint I hear from others about C is that relatively simple things take too much code or time to implement. With C+ it's that the language itself is too complex

2015-07-02 04:43:27	MrVandelay	C is faster with longer code that can be hard to get an overview of. C++ has a prettier syntax and, if used correctly, isn't that much slower. Seems to be the gist of it.
2015-07-02 04:43:30	Celti	Strawberries and clotted cream!
2015-07-02 04:43:49	MrVandelay	But at the level of faster vs slower we're talking now, we might aswell start comparing C to ASM

2015-07-02 05:12:50	Roukoswarf	get a 50W arm, and it would likely run faster than x86
2015-07-02 05:13:02	Roukoswarf	since risc has a faster average case
2015-07-02 05:13:40	Roukoswarf	cisc (like intel) is nicer for some specific things, but bad elsewhere
2015-07-02 05:13:49	archfan	well we might have to find alternatives soon with AMD dropping the basket.
2015-07-02 05:13:53	Roukoswarf	sure its easier to work with if you do assembly, but thats what compilers are for.

2015-07-02 05:36:02	archfan	doesn't watercooling save power because the chip runs cooler?
2015-07-02 05:36:39	archfan	which makes it more efficient
2015-07-02 05:36:50	-->	littlebunnyfufu (~quassel@unaffiliated/sonikkuamerica) has joined #archlinux-offtopic
2015-07-02 05:37:00	Roukoswarf	zerocore on amd prevents a lot of power leak at idle, since it can basically use nothing.
2015-07-02 05:37:06	archfan	maybe that's reason they went with liquid cooling.
2015-07-02 05:37:31	ekkelett	I see that the temperature isn't bad, Roukoswarf, but its power draw is as I guessed sub par, though not by much.
2015-07-02 05:37:46	Roukoswarf	its made up by zerocore
2015-07-02 05:37:53	ekkelett	Should see if there's an average somewhere...
2015-07-02 05:37:58	Roukoswarf	also another thing with the fury that nobody notices cause benches dont bench it
2015-07-02 05:38:10	Roukoswarf	it will be probably the best opencl consumer card
2015-07-02 05:38:25	Roukoswarf	that kind of memory is only seen on 4000$ commercial crap
2015-07-02 05:38:33	Roukoswarf	i want to test opencl on it
2015-07-02 05:38:51	Roukoswarf	nvidia opencl is intentionally b0rked, to sell more cuda
2015-07-02 05:39:04	Roukoswarf	and cuda is inferior in a lot of ways

2015-07-02 05:40:55	Hwkiller	I need a new machine, desperately.
2015-07-02 05:41:04	Roukoswarf	i see titanx as the most id ever need/want for a gaming card, and it happens to have wtf cores/memory for opencl
2015-07-02 05:41:10	Hwkiller	right now, a full build would be about $900 for me :(
2015-07-02 05:41:15	Roukoswarf	so, i like it for home workstations
2015-07-02 05:41:16	Hwkiller	which, on a grad student budget, isn't feasible
2015-07-02 05:41:22	ekkelett	but yes, if I were to upgrade a card now, I'd be very curious to get a 980ti, even though I don't quite need it
2015-07-02 05:41:33	archfan	Hwkiller: no spare parts around?
2015-07-02 05:41:34	ekkelett	it'd just be a nice route to go for buying a card and not thinking of it for a long, long time
2015-07-02 05:41:43	Hwkiller	archfan: all I have had in the past 8 years are laptops
2015-07-02 05:41:43	Roukoswarf	ekkelett: both cards would do that
2015-07-02 05:41:45	Hwkiller	so no :(
2015-07-02 05:42:03	Roukoswarf	most of my home boxes are on radeon 7850s
2015-07-02 05:42:12	krosos	nice, arch iso torrent got significantly faster/more widespread than last time. re-installing it on the netbook because it doesn't like anything i try to feed it so far other than stick with arch. and gentoo on arm was something i wanted to try, but at the same time it would be nuts.
2015-07-02 05:42:20	Roukoswarf	still 60fps most games at max, lol.
2015-07-02 05:42:24	Roukoswarf	200$ card
2015-07-02 05:42:24	ekkelett	Roukoswarf: I'd want to leave the SLI opportunity open, and after having used ATI/AMD in the past, I don't particularly enjoy crossfire due to its more noticeable frame stuttering and variance.
2015-07-02 05:42:34	archfan	Hwkiller: that sucks. but hey don't buy nvidia. ;)
2015-07-02 05:42:35	Crashlog	I've got a 7850 too. I'd like to get a fury, but I can't part with that kind of money right now
2015-07-02 05:42:38	Hwkiller	archfan: why?
2015-07-02 05:42:45	Hwkiller	it's still the better option on linux right now
2015-07-02 05:42:49	Roukoswarf	Crashlog: 7850 was an excellent buy
2015-07-02 05:42:54	krosos	so what about the rumours of amd getting bought up?
2015-07-02 05:43:01	Hwkiller	I was shooting for a nvidia 960
2015-07-02 05:43:05	ekkelett	I agree with Hwkiller, even though I despise the fact that you can't do multi-monitor with SLI.
2015-07-02 05:43:09	archfan	AMDs drivers on linux are catching up.
2015-07-02 05:43:12	ekkelett	(The weirdest thing, I just don't get it.)
2015-07-02 05:43:21	Hwkiller	archfan: yes, catching up
2015-07-02 05:43:27	Roukoswarf	SLI isnt worth it for gaming
2015-07-02 05:43:34	Roukoswarf	not really worth it for processing either
2015-07-02 05:43:35	Hwkiller	and yeah, I will never SLI/crossfire
2015-07-02 05:43:39	archfan	plus they need money. nvidia doesn't.
2015-07-02 05:43:39	Roukoswarf	since the overhead is wild
2015-07-02 05:43:40	archfan	.
2015-07-02 05:44:05	ekkelett	Dunno how you view worth it; I don't mind the 50%-88% performance improvement not worth it, Roukoswarf

2015-07-02 05:44:23	MrVandelay	The benches I've seen of the Fury places it as slower than the 980 Ti
2015-07-02 05:44:28	Roukoswarf	prefer to just have every pci slot filled with whatever does opencl/cuda the fastest (depending on application support for opencl/cuda)
2015-07-02 05:44:30	ekkelett	MrVandelay: it is.
2015-07-02 05:44:34	Roukoswarf	then just split tasks across gpus
2015-07-02 05:44:42	Crashlog	I'm kind of still hoping that with driver updates the fury can beat the 980ti in future benchmarks. That'd drive sales to AMD for once
2015-07-02 05:44:51	ekkelett	Not a bad idea, but I don't do any opencl/cuda work, just gaming with it.
2015-07-02 05:44:52	MrVandelay	One thing though
2015-07-02 05:45:05	MrVandelay	For processing tasks it might be different
2015-07-02 05:45:09	ekkelett	^
2015-07-02 05:45:17	archfan	NVIDIA seemingly cripples older cards in their drivers or at least doesn't do anything to improve performance.
2015-07-02 05:45:24	Roukoswarf	ekkelett: non sli is also nice for vms, can send cards to vms to use for processing/rendering.
2015-07-02 05:45:47	MrVandelay	nVidia's modern architecture is more optimized towards gaming than processing making some of their lower end cards faster at for example mining than their fastest cards
2015-07-02 05:46:12	Roukoswarf	mining is better in opencl, period.
2015-07-02 05:46:19	Roukoswarf	cuda kernel is crap
2015-07-02 05:46:29	ekkelett	Roukoswarf: yeah, that's the only scenario I've considered -- I would like to do kvm with PCIe passthrough, and in that event I'd do it with one powerful card instead of trying to do SLI
2015-07-02 05:46:46	ekkelett	not that I even know if SLI would work with PCIe passthrough, I don't see why it shouldn't, but I don't know.
2015-07-02 05:46:54	archfan	anything that doesn't involve mining and gold is crap.

2015-07-02 05:48:22	Roukoswarf	generally sli is bad for processing
2015-07-02 05:48:32	ekkelett	and my OC'd pair of 670's aren't quite powerful enough to run everything alone ;)
2015-07-02 05:48:48	MrVandelay	Their drivers, though closed source, are better than amd's both on linux and in windows in my opinion
2015-07-02 05:49:00	Roukoswarf	nvidia doesnt do their own drivers, thats why.
2015-07-02 05:49:13	krosos	no?

2015-07-02 05:58:57	ekkelett	I try to gradually move over to dvp
2015-07-02 05:58:59	MrVandelay	As if QWERTY in any layout isn't a convoluted mess everywhere
2015-07-02 05:59:11	ekkelett	However, using the compose key is indeed a pain in the ass, but luckily I don't use it too much ;)
2015-07-02 05:59:13	krosos	also, something like neo layout. it's awful when you type alot of english

2015-07-02 05:59:51	ekkelett	krosos: huh, like a German dvorak somewhat, eh?
2015-07-02 06:00:05	krosos	hmm... more or less
2015-07-02 06:00:14	krosos	there's dvorak german iirc
2015-07-02 06:00:16	MrVandelay	ekkelett: Yep
2015-07-02 06:00:20	krosos	neo2 is something else
2015-07-02 06:00:25	MrVandelay	I was just going to mention dvorak
2015-07-02 06:00:33	ekkelett	Yeah, I can't say, I use no-dvorak myself.
2015-07-02 06:00:45	ekkelett	Happy dvorak user since I was 15! :D
2015-07-02 06:00:54	MrVandelay	Was it worth it?
2015-07-02 06:01:06	ekkelett	Yip, as I didn't actually do proper touch typing before I switched to dvorak.
2015-07-02 06:01:19	Roukoswarf	i type like a maniac
2015-07-02 06:01:21	MrVandelay	I meant, do you have any benefits?
2015-07-02 06:01:22	krosos	sometimes i wonder if switching to neo2 would be worth it.
2015-07-02 06:01:24	Roukoswarf	i touch type without touching :p
2015-07-02 06:01:29	krosos	i don't typoe that much
2015-07-02 06:01:31	ekkelett	So not only did I get to enjoy the magic of dvorak, but I am more confined in actually keeping the letters at the right place with my fingers.
2015-07-02 06:01:53	ekkelett	Well,if I type qwerty I type like a maniac, and it ends... eh, relatively well. I still don't need to look
2015-07-02 06:01:56	Roukoswarf	ekkelett: i just memorize key positions and just expect them to be there, without keeping hands on keyboard.
2015-07-02 06:02:03	ekkelett	it just didn't involve my hands laying still, they'd be moving around all the time

2015-07-02 06:02:18	MrVandelay	My hands don't move a lot when typing in qwerty either
2015-07-02 06:02:25	demize	MrVandelay: QWERTY makes my fingers hurt.
2015-07-02 06:02:27	MrVandelay	I have very long fingers
2015-07-02 06:02:31	Roukoswarf	my hands dont move much in qwerty
2015-07-02 06:02:35	Roukoswarf	long fingers too
2015-07-02 06:02:36	Roukoswarf	lol
2015-07-02 06:02:40	ekkelett	It's not as tiresome as it used to be, and since it's dvorak -- I move my fingers _even less_ than if I had touch typed with qwerty.
2015-07-02 06:02:47	demize	(I have psoreatic arthritis)
2015-07-02 06:02:53	MrVandelay	I'll try dvorak one of these days
2015-07-02 06:02:59	Roukoswarf	dvorak is nice
2015-07-02 06:03:08	ekkelett	MrVandelay: I type slightly faster than I used to, at around 110-120 depending on how I'm feeling.
2015-07-02 06:03:16	ekkelett	Normally I type much slower because I spend too much time wondering about what to write.
2015-07-02 06:03:25	Roukoswarf	it is better, its just hard to move between both, since everyone else is on qwerty
2015-07-02 06:03:31	ekkelett	meh! :D
2015-07-02 06:03:33	MrVandelay	I've typed far faster than that when I was younger in qwerty ekkelett ^^

2015-07-02 06:04:11	ekkelett	I just relax and go chill, and the speed is more than quick enough for me :D
2015-07-02 06:04:11	MrVandelay	I'm kind of interested in trying out dvorak just for the hell of it.

2015-07-02 06:04:21	ekkelett	it's fun. :)
2015-07-02 06:04:24	ekkelett	I mean
2015-07-02 06:04:24	MrVandelay	Also, modern keyboards suck

2015-07-02 06:04:43	ekkelett	let's just say the first two-three months back at school was... frustrating
2015-07-02 06:05:04	ekkelett	At least I had a dvorak keyboard as my background image so that I could quickly refresh my memory lest I forgot about the positions
2015-07-02 06:05:08	dagle	demize: ?
2015-07-02 06:05:11	ekkelett	truth be told though, you quickly remember the positions, MrVandelay

2015-07-02 06:05:30	MrVandelay	ekkelett: The huge problem with dvorak as I see it is that it's not portable
2015-07-02 06:05:37	ekkelett	how so?
2015-07-02 06:05:46	ekkelett	It's a quick install, and your qwerty doesn't exactly disappear
2015-07-02 06:05:58	MrVandelay	ekkelett: You'll use dvorak on your desktop, then go out, and respond to facebook messages in your phone where your keyboard of choice doesn't support dvorak
2015-07-02 06:05:59	ekkelett	I barely ever, ever use qwerty, and if I do I'm still fine.
2015-07-02 06:06:02	ekkelett	oh

2015-07-02 06:06:10	ekkelett	dvorak isn't that good for phone keyboards

2015-07-02 21:39:02	MrVandelay	demize: Ironically I'm a BSD-fan which rivaled sysv at the time. But BSD.se was taken :-(
2015-07-02 21:39:15	MrVandelay	I just needed as few characters as possible because I hate typing long hostnames
2015-07-02 21:39:18	demize	;p
2015-07-02 21:39:28	sublimate	demize, I now have two tiny shell scripts which serialize and deserialize git repos in a directory into 3-tuples: http://pastie.org/10269849#10

2015-07-02 21:39:48	demize	(I'm distracted...)
2015-07-02 21:39:48	MrVandelay	demize: But SysV does still live on, albeit less now with systemd in place
2015-07-02 21:39:51	Tom^	demize: so you have found yourself a job?
2015-07-02 21:39:52	demize	sublimate: :p
2015-07-02 21:40:04	demize	MrVandelay: Sadly.
2015-07-02 21:40:08	demize	Tom^: sommarjobb, ja.
2015-07-02 21:40:10	sublimate	demize, Do you have to deal with the Canadian keyboard?
2015-07-02 21:40:33	Tom^	demize: thats where things start, filling the CV up until they start finding you interesting :p
2015-07-02 21:40:34	demize	sublimate: That's so awful.
2015-07-02 21:40:42	sublimate	demize, Yes, yes it is. xD
2015-07-02 21:40:44	demize	sublimate: No, Swedish if I can't get an American one.
2015-07-02 21:40:51	demize	Tom^: :p
2015-07-02 21:40:59	demize	Tom^: I donno about that.
2015-07-02 21:41:03	sublimate	Shell script glue holds the world together.
2015-07-02 21:41:12	demize	sublimate: Have you asked them about using submodules?
2015-07-02 21:41:25	sublimate	demize, Yes, it doesn't work for our use case apparently.
2015-07-02 21:41:34	demize	sublimate: git-submodule is a shell script as well.
2015-07-02 21:41:37	demize	sublimate: How so?
2015-07-02 21:41:39	Tom^	demize: my first 4 years after school was only summerjobs, then i finally got a fulltime. now whenever i send in a application they dial almost instantly and wants an interview
2015-07-02 21:42:17	sublimate	demize, Apparently because git submodules tracks commits instead of branches, and thus won't stay up-to-date without us constantly updating it.
2015-07-02 21:42:50	demize	sublimate: Meh, you can just update the repo in the submodule whenever you want to update it ಠ_ಠ
2015-07-02 21:43:03	demize	(And I'm not talking about committing the updated repo even.)
2015-07-02 21:43:06	MrVandelay	demize: Well, I have less against systemd in practice than I do in theory
2015-07-02 21:43:16	MrVandelay	demize: The thing is freaking fast.
2015-07-02 21:43:35	demize	MrVandelay: Meh, don't need systemd for speed.
2015-07-02 21:43:41	bougyman	I have git aliases for that which get called as pre-commit-msg hooks.
2015-07-02 21:43:46	bougyman	sup  = !git submodule foreach git pull ssup  = !git submodule foreach git sup
2015-07-02 21:43:52	MrVandelay	demize: Still, it's fast as hell.

2015-07-03 04:11:26	sup3rman	well i use awesome today... so with that you configure pretty much everything. guess i might need to get in another mindset
2015-07-03 04:11:41	MrVandelay	But you can write it in whatever you want. You just write anything that outputs the info you want and then you pipe it to the FIFO that goes into lemon bar

2015-07-03 06:17:22	krosos	i really wouldn't know because i'm really terrible at opening conversations with strangers when i don't need to ask (for example) about getting soemwhere or something. it's getting better for some years now, but i'm still bad at it.
2015-07-03 06:17:34	wasamasa	by utalitarian I mean something like when the train is inacceptably late and they start speaking about how horrible the public transport system is

2015-07-03 06:29:47	Achillion	She was friends with a classmate of mine and we met through her.
2015-07-03 06:30:04	zamber	"want me to help you with your hardware?"
2015-07-03 06:30:07	Achillion	It was totally casual and unplanned and it wasn't really the way you imagine.

2015-07-03 06:30:24	dexter	thanks :)
2015-07-03 06:30:28	Achillion	The actual contact that led to us getting together happened years later when I recognised her in a bar.

2015-07-07 20:54:07	phrik	<sudokode> ubuntu comes with a compiler?
2015-07-07 20:54:43	Timmy_L	So, I've got an ASUS Maximus IV Extreme-Z that I'm trying to flash the BIOS of. I got the latest version from the website (not the Windows versions) and put it on a FAT32-formatted USB, but when I select the file in the ASUS EZ Flash 2 Utility it says "Selexted file is not a EFI BIOS!". My Google-fu told me I needed to put it on a FAT32-formatted USB, remove the version number from the filename
2015-07-07 20:54:49	Timmy_L	 and another post said the filename needed to be => 8 characters, none of the solutions have worked for me.
2015-07-07 20:54:52	Timmy_L	Any ideas?
2015-07-07 20:55:05	Timmy_L	s/Selexted/Selected
2015-07-07 20:55:38	sheep	does its name end in .efi?
2015-07-07 20:55:39	Timmy_L	and =<, not =>.
2015-07-07 20:55:44	Timmy_L	Nope. .ROM
2015-07-07 20:55:46	sheep	if not, rename it to whatever.efi
2015-07-07 20:55:54	Timmy_L	I'll try that.
2015-07-07 20:56:02	sheep	also, what does 'file whatever.ROM' say about it?
2015-07-07 20:56:33	Timmy_L	Max.ROM: Intel serial flash for PCH ROM
2015-07-07 20:56:52	sheep	what
2015-07-07 20:57:23	Timmy_L	That's what file Max.ROM returned. :P
2015-07-07 20:57:27	sheep	so renaming it to .efi probably won
2015-07-07 20:57:31	SysGhost	Also try repartition the flash drive. Some times they come with a custom partition table (or none at all)
2015-07-07 20:57:33	sheep	't help, but try it anyway
2015-07-07 20:57:48	Timmy_L	Yeah I put a whole new msdos partition table on it before I made it FAT32
2015-07-07 20:58:40	Timmy_L	I might try making it FAT16 too, but from what I've read it's supposed to be done with FAT32.
2015-07-07 20:58:58	SysGhost	and the partition ID was set to the equivalent of FAT32 ? (07 or 0b, don't remember)
2015-07-07 20:59:07	Timmy_L	Uh, it doesn't even seem to want to find the file when I renamed it to .efi
2015-07-07 20:59:37	Timmy_L	SysGhost: I think so, I'll double check in a second.

2015-07-07 21:01:23	SysGhost	Well. It does find the file, so it shouldn't be the fs nor the partition table. Perhaps the file is incomplete. Check and compare the checksum if ASUS provides any.
2015-07-07 21:01:39	SysGhost	redownload it
2015-07-07 21:01:55	sheep	or maybe you need a different version of the file
2015-07-07 21:02:25	SysGhost	indeed. ASUS often have several sub-versions of a motherboard serie.
2015-07-07 21:02:30	Timmy_L	fdisk recognized it as fat32 (I can't seem to remember how to check the actual ID).

2015-07-07 21:09:12	Timmy_L	Hm, they don't provide a checksum, but across three different downloads of the same file I get the same md5sum, so I doubt it's that. Might try some of the other versions, but they all should be for the same motherboard (extreme-z which is the one I have, and not "extreme", "gene-z" or "gene-z/gen3" which share the "ASUS Maximus IV" product name)
2015-07-07 21:09:48	Timmy_L	Oh well, I think I'll tackle the issue in a few hours again, usually helps me to occupy my brain with different things for a while. Thanks for the suggestions.

2015-07-07 23:16:20	mankypirate	I have a passively cooled ATI that I used for a while in lieu of intel
2015-07-07 23:16:26	Votato	Did it achieve more than 5fps without crashing?

2015-07-07 23:20:48	Achillion	Guys
2015-07-07 23:20:53	Achillion	Votato is talking about Windows.
2015-07-07 23:20:56	krosos	sounds like you use the open source ati driver
2015-07-07 23:21:15	Votato	I do, because the closed source one a) artifacts and b) massive input lag
2015-07-07 23:21:34	Votato	Plus "60fps" on the closed source driver feels like 30fps for some reason
2015-07-07 23:21:36	Achillion	I think the only sort of demanding game I've run on both platforms natively is Borderlands 2
2015-07-07 23:21:47	krosos	then it might be a) your card b) something else or c) i have no idea about cards
2015-07-07 23:22:26	Votato	I think it might be AMD OpenGL support not being up to scratch, I tried OpenGL ETS2 on Windows, performed much poorer than the DX version
2015-07-07 23:23:09	krosos	multilib support?
2015-07-07 23:23:39	GI_Jack	Votato, thats because its lack of freedom
2015-07-07 23:25:34	Votato	So reasons against Nvidia?
2015-07-07 23:25:42	Votato	Apart from Linus' 'fuck you'
2015-07-07 23:26:05	krosos	wait some more time until ati releases their new driver.
