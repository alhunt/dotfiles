2015-07-02 02:59:44	Celti	Because if you've never been there you're not allowed to have an opinion about the things they're doing that you dislike, obviously! :-p

2015-07-02 03:02:00	TheNumb	*would
2015-07-02 03:02:04	Crashlog	Because it sounds like poutine
2015-07-02 03:02:05	Celti	I'd totally eat Putin. Mmmm, the sweetness of a Soviet dictator...

2015-07-02 03:02:37	Celti	poutine is delicious
2015-07-02 03:02:40	voidead	Putin eats bears.. so probably plenty of protein
2015-07-02 03:03:06	Celti	it's nigh-impossible to find real cheese curds to make it out here in the desert, though
2015-07-02 03:03:21	voidead	Celti: desert?
2015-07-02 03:03:32	 *	Celti lives in the Sonoran Desert.
2015-07-02 03:03:35	oats	I once got to eat fresh cheese curds while in wisconsin
2015-07-02 03:03:39	oats	they're fantastic
2015-07-02 03:03:52	krosos	i find "nation birthdays" very weird and they creep me out, no matter which country. even more slaughter-of-natives eh sorry columbus-day and similar days
2015-07-02 03:03:53	oats	squeaky creamy deliciousness
2015-07-02 03:03:54	voidead	not sure if I would ever live in a desert
2015-07-02 03:03:58	Celti	oats: Indeed.
2015-07-02 03:04:27	ekkelett	Crashlog: Swedish?
2015-07-02 03:04:27	Celti	voidead: I grew up here, so... it's not bad, but I want to move to the Pacific Northwest or somewhere else where I can avoid ever seeing the sun again.
2015-07-02 03:04:46	Crashlog	ekkelett, nope. Finnish. Why?
2015-07-02 03:04:51	oats	Celti: how 'bout britian? :D

2015-07-02 03:05:14	Celti	voidead: No, in northern Alaska the sun is up for half the year!
2015-07-02 03:05:14	voidead	they have a long darkness
2015-07-02 03:05:34	voidead	half dark too
2015-07-02 03:05:56	Crashlog	Call up McMurdo and ask if they'll take you on as free labour
2015-07-02 03:06:00	Celti	Obviously I have to have a migratory pattern, following the darkness from the Arctic Circle to the Antarctic.
2015-07-02 03:06:06	voidead	Celti: just cover your windows
2015-07-02 03:06:07	oats	I can't help but wonder what it'd be like to live in a place like deadhorse, ak
2015-07-02 03:06:20	Celti	voidead: And never leave my house?
2015-07-02 03:06:23	ekkelett	Crashlog: ah, that makes sense. You share the same typical nordic layouts as Norwegians, Swedes and Danes do, don't you?
2015-07-02 03:06:43	voidead	Celti: why worry
2015-07-02 03:06:45	ekkelett	Crashlog: also, obligatory "perkele!"
2015-07-02 03:06:48	ekkelett	:D
2015-07-02 03:06:48	krosos	what layouts
2015-07-02 03:06:57	ekkelett	krosos: the keyboard kind
2015-07-02 03:07:00	oats	krosos: I assume they're talking about keyboard layouts
2015-07-02 03:07:01	krosos	oh
2015-07-02 03:07:06	voidead	just cover up when at home
2015-07-02 03:07:30	Crashlog	ekkelett, I'm pretty sure it's the same layout for all of us since manufacturers always call it a nordic layout
2015-07-02 03:07:36	Celti	other reasons to hate the desert: today is unnaturally cool at a low low 40°C.
2015-07-02 03:07:44	ekkelett	Crashlog: that's what I'm assuming
2015-07-02 03:07:54	ekkelett	Celti: that's just awfully cold.
2015-07-02 03:08:01	Crashlog	Celti, better cover up then so you don't freeze to death
2015-07-02 03:08:09	voidead	Celti: I hate cold weather though
2015-07-02 03:08:19	Crashlog	Don't deserts get really cold during the night?
2015-07-02 03:08:23	krosos	low as in 40°C? where do you live?
2015-07-02 03:09:08	Celti	Crashlog: They do when you don't build 20,000 sq. km of city in them.
2015-07-02 03:09:17	Celti	krosos: Phoenix, Arizona, USA.
2015-07-02 03:09:20	krosos	oh
2015-07-02 03:09:55	Crashlog	Oh. I hear the pavement melts the soles of your shoes off during the day down around those parts. RIP in peace
2015-07-02 03:09:55	Celti	The temperature basically won't drop below 30°C all summer, even at night.
2015-07-02 03:10:20	Celti	Crashlog: Yeah, if you're not careful about what shoes you buy they will melt
2015-07-02 03:10:33	Celti	The pavement can get hot enough to literally fry an egg
2015-07-02 03:10:36	MrVandelay	Anyone using urxvt-vtwheel? It seems to not be working
2015-07-02 03:10:47	Celti	there's also one guy I know that bakes cookies in his car every summer

2015-07-02 03:15:38	MrVandelay	Not usually
2015-07-02 03:15:44	Celti	It won't load the new extensions if you don't.
2015-07-02 03:15:48	MrVandelay	I'll just try starting a regular urxvt process and see if that works
2015-07-02 03:16:19	MrVandelay	Celti: That has probably changed, because it does now

2015-07-02 03:29:13	dunz0r	Apart from the really stupid logging, now that I've used systemd for a while, it's not that bad
2015-07-02 03:29:26	dunz0r	But I really hate the binary logging and convoluted interface with silly levels and shit.
2015-07-02 03:29:40	ekkelett	While it's binary, I love the easy filtering it gives along with the metadata.

2015-07-02 04:01:30	ekkelett	Why not download a higher quality 720p scene release or similarly, krosos?
2015-07-02 04:01:36	Crashlog	Always go for the 30GB BD rips
2015-07-02 04:01:40	archfan	ALWAYS
2015-07-02 04:01:45	Crashlog	Literally always
2015-07-02 04:01:52	krosos	eh because the uncut version was only released on dvd o-O

2015-07-02 04:04:35	dunz0r	I always go with the 8-10GB 1080p, that's enough for me
2015-07-02 04:04:43	dunz0r	God damn p2p-shit axxo.
2015-07-02 04:04:57	Crashlog	The least they could do is take the DVD, rip the content, burn it to a BD and then rip that. Boom, quality upgraded
2015-07-02 04:05:18	dunz0r	No, upscaled...
2015-07-02 04:05:19	archfan	indeed
2015-07-02 04:05:37	ekkelett	It's not like Crashlog was joking or anything.
2015-07-02 04:05:44	ekkelett	Certainly he was deadly serious in what he said. :p
2015-07-02 04:05:54	krosos	fyi, the original master of dark star is lost, which is why everything sold as dark star these days looks like shit. and not every movie on bluray looks better

2015-07-02 04:28:10	Crashlog	The conclusion is that there are no good programming languages

2015-07-02 04:31:10	Crashlog	My programming knowledge is limited to Python and Java, and is _very_ limited at that. I couldn't really tell you what's wrong with any of them from my personal experience. That said, the most common complaint I hear from others about C is that relatively simple things take too much code or time to implement. With C+ it's that the language itself is too complex

2015-07-02 04:43:27	MrVandelay	C is faster with longer code that can be hard to get an overview of. C++ has a prettier syntax and, if used correctly, isn't that much slower. Seems to be the gist of it.
2015-07-02 04:43:30	Celti	Strawberries and clotted cream!
2015-07-02 04:43:49	MrVandelay	But at the level of faster vs slower we're talking now, we might aswell start comparing C to ASM

2015-07-02 05:12:50	Roukoswarf	get a 50W arm, and it would likely run faster than x86
2015-07-02 05:13:02	Roukoswarf	since risc has a faster average case
2015-07-02 05:13:40	Roukoswarf	cisc (like intel) is nicer for some specific things, but bad elsewhere
2015-07-02 05:13:49	archfan	well we might have to find alternatives soon with AMD dropping the basket.
2015-07-02 05:13:53	Roukoswarf	sure its easier to work with if you do assembly, but thats what compilers are for.

2015-07-02 05:36:02	archfan	doesn't watercooling save power because the chip runs cooler?
2015-07-02 05:36:39	archfan	which makes it more efficient
2015-07-02 05:36:50	-->	littlebunnyfufu (~quassel@unaffiliated/sonikkuamerica) has joined #archlinux-offtopic
2015-07-02 05:37:00	Roukoswarf	zerocore on amd prevents a lot of power leak at idle, since it can basically use nothing.
2015-07-02 05:37:06	archfan	maybe that's reason they went with liquid cooling.
2015-07-02 05:37:31	ekkelett	I see that the temperature isn't bad, Roukoswarf, but its power draw is as I guessed sub par, though not by much.
2015-07-02 05:37:46	Roukoswarf	its made up by zerocore
2015-07-02 05:37:53	ekkelett	Should see if there's an average somewhere...
2015-07-02 05:37:58	Roukoswarf	also another thing with the fury that nobody notices cause benches dont bench it
2015-07-02 05:38:10	Roukoswarf	it will be probably the best opencl consumer card
2015-07-02 05:38:25	Roukoswarf	that kind of memory is only seen on 4000$ commercial crap
2015-07-02 05:38:33	Roukoswarf	i want to test opencl on it
2015-07-02 05:38:51	Roukoswarf	nvidia opencl is intentionally b0rked, to sell more cuda
2015-07-02 05:39:04	Roukoswarf	and cuda is inferior in a lot of ways

2015-07-02 05:40:55	Hwkiller	I need a new machine, desperately.
2015-07-02 05:41:04	Roukoswarf	i see titanx as the most id ever need/want for a gaming card, and it happens to have wtf cores/memory for opencl
2015-07-02 05:41:10	Hwkiller	right now, a full build would be about $900 for me :(
2015-07-02 05:41:15	Roukoswarf	so, i like it for home workstations
2015-07-02 05:41:16	Hwkiller	which, on a grad student budget, isn't feasible
2015-07-02 05:41:22	ekkelett	but yes, if I were to upgrade a card now, I'd be very curious to get a 980ti, even though I don't quite need it
2015-07-02 05:41:33	archfan	Hwkiller: no spare parts around?
2015-07-02 05:41:34	ekkelett	it'd just be a nice route to go for buying a card and not thinking of it for a long, long time
2015-07-02 05:41:43	Hwkiller	archfan: all I have had in the past 8 years are laptops
2015-07-02 05:41:43	Roukoswarf	ekkelett: both cards would do that
2015-07-02 05:41:45	Hwkiller	so no :(
2015-07-02 05:42:03	Roukoswarf	most of my home boxes are on radeon 7850s
2015-07-02 05:42:12	krosos	nice, arch iso torrent got significantly faster/more widespread than last time. re-installing it on the netbook because it doesn't like anything i try to feed it so far other than stick with arch. and gentoo on arm was something i wanted to try, but at the same time it would be nuts.
2015-07-02 05:42:20	Roukoswarf	still 60fps most games at max, lol.
2015-07-02 05:42:24	Roukoswarf	200$ card
2015-07-02 05:42:24	ekkelett	Roukoswarf: I'd want to leave the SLI opportunity open, and after having used ATI/AMD in the past, I don't particularly enjoy crossfire due to its more noticeable frame stuttering and variance.
2015-07-02 05:42:34	archfan	Hwkiller: that sucks. but hey don't buy nvidia. ;)
2015-07-02 05:42:35	Crashlog	I've got a 7850 too. I'd like to get a fury, but I can't part with that kind of money right now
2015-07-02 05:42:38	Hwkiller	archfan: why?
2015-07-02 05:42:45	Hwkiller	it's still the better option on linux right now
2015-07-02 05:42:49	Roukoswarf	Crashlog: 7850 was an excellent buy
2015-07-02 05:42:54	krosos	so what about the rumours of amd getting bought up?
2015-07-02 05:43:01	Hwkiller	I was shooting for a nvidia 960
2015-07-02 05:43:05	ekkelett	I agree with Hwkiller, even though I despise the fact that you can't do multi-monitor with SLI.
2015-07-02 05:43:09	archfan	AMDs drivers on linux are catching up.
2015-07-02 05:43:12	ekkelett	(The weirdest thing, I just don't get it.)
2015-07-02 05:43:21	Hwkiller	archfan: yes, catching up
2015-07-02 05:43:27	Roukoswarf	SLI isnt worth it for gaming
2015-07-02 05:43:34	Roukoswarf	not really worth it for processing either
2015-07-02 05:43:35	Hwkiller	and yeah, I will never SLI/crossfire
2015-07-02 05:43:39	archfan	plus they need money. nvidia doesn't.
2015-07-02 05:43:39	Roukoswarf	since the overhead is wild
2015-07-02 05:43:40	archfan	.
2015-07-02 05:44:05	ekkelett	Dunno how you view worth it; I don't mind the 50%-88% performance improvement not worth it, Roukoswarf

2015-07-02 05:44:23	MrVandelay	The benches I've seen of the Fury places it as slower than the 980 Ti
2015-07-02 05:44:28	Roukoswarf	prefer to just have every pci slot filled with whatever does opencl/cuda the fastest (depending on application support for opencl/cuda)
2015-07-02 05:44:30	ekkelett	MrVandelay: it is.
2015-07-02 05:44:34	Roukoswarf	then just split tasks across gpus
2015-07-02 05:44:42	Crashlog	I'm kind of still hoping that with driver updates the fury can beat the 980ti in future benchmarks. That'd drive sales to AMD for once
2015-07-02 05:44:51	ekkelett	Not a bad idea, but I don't do any opencl/cuda work, just gaming with it.
2015-07-02 05:44:52	MrVandelay	One thing though
2015-07-02 05:45:05	MrVandelay	For processing tasks it might be different
2015-07-02 05:45:09	ekkelett	^
2015-07-02 05:45:17	archfan	NVIDIA seemingly cripples older cards in their drivers or at least doesn't do anything to improve performance.
2015-07-02 05:45:24	Roukoswarf	ekkelett: non sli is also nice for vms, can send cards to vms to use for processing/rendering.
2015-07-02 05:45:47	MrVandelay	nVidia's modern architecture is more optimized towards gaming than processing making some of their lower end cards faster at for example mining than their fastest cards
2015-07-02 05:46:12	Roukoswarf	mining is better in opencl, period.
2015-07-02 05:46:19	Roukoswarf	cuda kernel is crap
2015-07-02 05:46:29	ekkelett	Roukoswarf: yeah, that's the only scenario I've considered -- I would like to do kvm with PCIe passthrough, and in that event I'd do it with one powerful card instead of trying to do SLI
2015-07-02 05:46:46	ekkelett	not that I even know if SLI would work with PCIe passthrough, I don't see why it shouldn't, but I don't know.
2015-07-02 05:46:54	archfan	anything that doesn't involve mining and gold is crap.

2015-07-02 05:48:22	Roukoswarf	generally sli is bad for processing
2015-07-02 05:48:32	ekkelett	and my OC'd pair of 670's aren't quite powerful enough to run everything alone ;)
2015-07-02 05:48:48	MrVandelay	Their drivers, though closed source, are better than amd's both on linux and in windows in my opinion
2015-07-02 05:49:00	Roukoswarf	nvidia doesnt do their own drivers, thats why.
2015-07-02 05:49:13	krosos	no?

2015-07-02 05:58:57	ekkelett	I try to gradually move over to dvp
2015-07-02 05:58:59	MrVandelay	As if QWERTY in any layout isn't a convoluted mess everywhere
2015-07-02 05:59:11	ekkelett	However, using the compose key is indeed a pain in the ass, but luckily I don't use it too much ;)
2015-07-02 05:59:13	krosos	also, something like neo layout. it's awful when you type alot of english

2015-07-02 05:59:51	ekkelett	krosos: huh, like a German dvorak somewhat, eh?
2015-07-02 06:00:05	krosos	hmm... more or less
2015-07-02 06:00:14	krosos	there's dvorak german iirc
2015-07-02 06:00:16	MrVandelay	ekkelett: Yep
2015-07-02 06:00:20	krosos	neo2 is something else
2015-07-02 06:00:25	MrVandelay	I was just going to mention dvorak
2015-07-02 06:00:33	ekkelett	Yeah, I can't say, I use no-dvorak myself.
2015-07-02 06:00:45	ekkelett	Happy dvorak user since I was 15! :D
2015-07-02 06:00:54	MrVandelay	Was it worth it?
2015-07-02 06:01:06	ekkelett	Yip, as I didn't actually do proper touch typing before I switched to dvorak.
2015-07-02 06:01:19	Roukoswarf	i type like a maniac
2015-07-02 06:01:21	MrVandelay	I meant, do you have any benefits?
2015-07-02 06:01:22	krosos	sometimes i wonder if switching to neo2 would be worth it.
2015-07-02 06:01:24	Roukoswarf	i touch type without touching :p
2015-07-02 06:01:29	krosos	i don't typoe that much
2015-07-02 06:01:31	ekkelett	So not only did I get to enjoy the magic of dvorak, but I am more confined in actually keeping the letters at the right place with my fingers.
2015-07-02 06:01:53	ekkelett	Well,if I type qwerty I type like a maniac, and it ends... eh, relatively well. I still don't need to look
2015-07-02 06:01:56	Roukoswarf	ekkelett: i just memorize key positions and just expect them to be there, without keeping hands on keyboard.
2015-07-02 06:02:03	ekkelett	it just didn't involve my hands laying still, they'd be moving around all the time

2015-07-02 06:02:18	MrVandelay	My hands don't move a lot when typing in qwerty either
2015-07-02 06:02:25	demize	MrVandelay: QWERTY makes my fingers hurt.
2015-07-02 06:02:27	MrVandelay	I have very long fingers
2015-07-02 06:02:31	Roukoswarf	my hands dont move much in qwerty
2015-07-02 06:02:35	Roukoswarf	long fingers too
2015-07-02 06:02:36	Roukoswarf	lol
2015-07-02 06:02:40	ekkelett	It's not as tiresome as it used to be, and since it's dvorak -- I move my fingers _even less_ than if I had touch typed with qwerty.
2015-07-02 06:02:47	demize	(I have psoreatic arthritis)
2015-07-02 06:02:53	MrVandelay	I'll try dvorak one of these days
2015-07-02 06:02:59	Roukoswarf	dvorak is nice
2015-07-02 06:03:08	ekkelett	MrVandelay: I type slightly faster than I used to, at around 110-120 depending on how I'm feeling.
2015-07-02 06:03:16	ekkelett	Normally I type much slower because I spend too much time wondering about what to write.
2015-07-02 06:03:25	Roukoswarf	it is better, its just hard to move between both, since everyone else is on qwerty
2015-07-02 06:03:31	ekkelett	meh! :D
2015-07-02 06:03:33	MrVandelay	I've typed far faster than that when I was younger in qwerty ekkelett ^^

2015-07-02 06:04:11	ekkelett	I just relax and go chill, and the speed is more than quick enough for me :D
2015-07-02 06:04:11	MrVandelay	I'm kind of interested in trying out dvorak just for the hell of it.

2015-07-02 06:04:21	ekkelett	it's fun. :)
2015-07-02 06:04:24	ekkelett	I mean
2015-07-02 06:04:24	MrVandelay	Also, modern keyboards suck

2015-07-02 06:04:43	ekkelett	let's just say the first two-three months back at school was... frustrating
2015-07-02 06:05:04	ekkelett	At least I had a dvorak keyboard as my background image so that I could quickly refresh my memory lest I forgot about the positions
2015-07-02 06:05:08	dagle	demize: ?
2015-07-02 06:05:11	ekkelett	truth be told though, you quickly remember the positions, MrVandelay

2015-07-02 06:05:30	MrVandelay	ekkelett: The huge problem with dvorak as I see it is that it's not portable
2015-07-02 06:05:37	ekkelett	how so?
2015-07-02 06:05:46	ekkelett	It's a quick install, and your qwerty doesn't exactly disappear
2015-07-02 06:05:58	MrVandelay	ekkelett: You'll use dvorak on your desktop, then go out, and respond to facebook messages in your phone where your keyboard of choice doesn't support dvorak
2015-07-02 06:05:59	ekkelett	I barely ever, ever use qwerty, and if I do I'm still fine.
2015-07-02 06:06:02	ekkelett	oh

2015-07-02 06:06:10	ekkelett	dvorak isn't that good for phone keyboards

2015-07-02 21:39:02	MrVandelay	demize: Ironically I'm a BSD-fan which rivaled sysv at the time. But BSD.se was taken :-(
2015-07-02 21:39:15	MrVandelay	I just needed as few characters as possible because I hate typing long hostnames
2015-07-02 21:39:18	demize	;p
2015-07-02 21:39:28	sublimate	demize, I now have two tiny shell scripts which serialize and deserialize git repos in a directory into 3-tuples: http://pastie.org/10269849#10

2015-07-02 21:39:48	demize	(I'm distracted...)
2015-07-02 21:39:48	MrVandelay	demize: But SysV does still live on, albeit less now with systemd in place
2015-07-02 21:39:51	Tom^	demize: so you have found yourself a job?
2015-07-02 21:39:52	demize	sublimate: :p
2015-07-02 21:40:04	demize	MrVandelay: Sadly.
2015-07-02 21:40:08	demize	Tom^: sommarjobb, ja.
2015-07-02 21:40:10	sublimate	demize, Do you have to deal with the Canadian keyboard?
2015-07-02 21:40:33	Tom^	demize: thats where things start, filling the CV up until they start finding you interesting :p
2015-07-02 21:40:34	demize	sublimate: That's so awful.
2015-07-02 21:40:42	sublimate	demize, Yes, yes it is. xD
2015-07-02 21:40:44	demize	sublimate: No, Swedish if I can't get an American one.
2015-07-02 21:40:51	demize	Tom^: :p
2015-07-02 21:40:59	demize	Tom^: I donno about that.
2015-07-02 21:41:03	sublimate	Shell script glue holds the world together.
2015-07-02 21:41:12	demize	sublimate: Have you asked them about using submodules?
2015-07-02 21:41:25	sublimate	demize, Yes, it doesn't work for our use case apparently.
2015-07-02 21:41:34	demize	sublimate: git-submodule is a shell script as well.
2015-07-02 21:41:37	demize	sublimate: How so?
2015-07-02 21:41:39	Tom^	demize: my first 4 years after school was only summerjobs, then i finally got a fulltime. now whenever i send in a application they dial almost instantly and wants an interview
2015-07-02 21:42:17	sublimate	demize, Apparently because git submodules tracks commits instead of branches, and thus won't stay up-to-date without us constantly updating it.
2015-07-02 21:42:50	demize	sublimate: Meh, you can just update the repo in the submodule whenever you want to update it ಠ_ಠ
2015-07-02 21:43:03	demize	(And I'm not talking about committing the updated repo even.)
2015-07-02 21:43:06	MrVandelay	demize: Well, I have less against systemd in practice than I do in theory
2015-07-02 21:43:16	MrVandelay	demize: The thing is freaking fast.
2015-07-02 21:43:35	demize	MrVandelay: Meh, don't need systemd for speed.
2015-07-02 21:43:41	bougyman	I have git aliases for that which get called as pre-commit-msg hooks.
2015-07-02 21:43:46	bougyman	sup  = !git submodule foreach git pull ssup  = !git submodule foreach git sup
2015-07-02 21:43:52	MrVandelay	demize: Still, it's fast as hell.

2015-07-03 04:11:26	sup3rman	well i use awesome today... so with that you configure pretty much everything. guess i might need to get in another mindset
2015-07-03 04:11:41	MrVandelay	But you can write it in whatever you want. You just write anything that outputs the info you want and then you pipe it to the FIFO that goes into lemon bar

2015-07-03 06:17:22	krosos	i really wouldn't know because i'm really terrible at opening conversations with strangers when i don't need to ask (for example) about getting soemwhere or something. it's getting better for some years now, but i'm still bad at it.
2015-07-03 06:17:34	wasamasa	by utalitarian I mean something like when the train is inacceptably late and they start speaking about how horrible the public transport system is

2015-07-03 06:29:47	Achillion	She was friends with a classmate of mine and we met through her.
2015-07-03 06:30:04	zamber	"want me to help you with your hardware?"
2015-07-03 06:30:07	Achillion	It was totally casual and unplanned and it wasn't really the way you imagine.

2015-07-03 06:30:24	dexter	thanks :)
2015-07-03 06:30:28	Achillion	The actual contact that led to us getting together happened years later when I recognised her in a bar.

2015-07-07 20:54:07	phrik	<sudokode> ubuntu comes with a compiler?
2015-07-07 20:54:43	Timmy_L	So, I've got an ASUS Maximus IV Extreme-Z that I'm trying to flash the BIOS of. I got the latest version from the website (not the Windows versions) and put it on a FAT32-formatted USB, but when I select the file in the ASUS EZ Flash 2 Utility it says "Selexted file is not a EFI BIOS!". My Google-fu told me I needed to put it on a FAT32-formatted USB, remove the version number from the filename
2015-07-07 20:54:49	Timmy_L	 and another post said the filename needed to be => 8 characters, none of the solutions have worked for me.
2015-07-07 20:54:52	Timmy_L	Any ideas?
2015-07-07 20:55:05	Timmy_L	s/Selexted/Selected
2015-07-07 20:55:38	sheep	does its name end in .efi?
2015-07-07 20:55:39	Timmy_L	and =<, not =>.
2015-07-07 20:55:44	Timmy_L	Nope. .ROM
2015-07-07 20:55:46	sheep	if not, rename it to whatever.efi
2015-07-07 20:55:54	Timmy_L	I'll try that.
2015-07-07 20:56:02	sheep	also, what does 'file whatever.ROM' say about it?
2015-07-07 20:56:33	Timmy_L	Max.ROM: Intel serial flash for PCH ROM
2015-07-07 20:56:52	sheep	what
2015-07-07 20:57:23	Timmy_L	That's what file Max.ROM returned. :P
2015-07-07 20:57:27	sheep	so renaming it to .efi probably won
2015-07-07 20:57:31	SysGhost	Also try repartition the flash drive. Some times they come with a custom partition table (or none at all)
2015-07-07 20:57:33	sheep	't help, but try it anyway
2015-07-07 20:57:48	Timmy_L	Yeah I put a whole new msdos partition table on it before I made it FAT32
2015-07-07 20:58:40	Timmy_L	I might try making it FAT16 too, but from what I've read it's supposed to be done with FAT32.
2015-07-07 20:58:58	SysGhost	and the partition ID was set to the equivalent of FAT32 ? (07 or 0b, don't remember)
2015-07-07 20:59:07	Timmy_L	Uh, it doesn't even seem to want to find the file when I renamed it to .efi
2015-07-07 20:59:37	Timmy_L	SysGhost: I think so, I'll double check in a second.

2015-07-07 21:01:23	SysGhost	Well. It does find the file, so it shouldn't be the fs nor the partition table. Perhaps the file is incomplete. Check and compare the checksum if ASUS provides any.
2015-07-07 21:01:39	SysGhost	redownload it
2015-07-07 21:01:55	sheep	or maybe you need a different version of the file
2015-07-07 21:02:25	SysGhost	indeed. ASUS often have several sub-versions of a motherboard serie.
2015-07-07 21:02:30	Timmy_L	fdisk recognized it as fat32 (I can't seem to remember how to check the actual ID).

2015-07-07 21:09:12	Timmy_L	Hm, they don't provide a checksum, but across three different downloads of the same file I get the same md5sum, so I doubt it's that. Might try some of the other versions, but they all should be for the same motherboard (extreme-z which is the one I have, and not "extreme", "gene-z" or "gene-z/gen3" which share the "ASUS Maximus IV" product name)
2015-07-07 21:09:48	Timmy_L	Oh well, I think I'll tackle the issue in a few hours again, usually helps me to occupy my brain with different things for a while. Thanks for the suggestions.

2015-07-07 23:20:53	Achillion	Votato is talking about Windows.
2015-07-07 23:20:56	krosos	sounds like you use the open source ati driver
2015-07-07 23:21:15	Votato	I do, because the closed source one a) artifacts and b) massive input lag
2015-07-07 23:21:34	Votato	Plus "60fps" on the closed source driver feels like 30fps for some reason
2015-07-07 23:21:36	Achillion	I think the only sort of demanding game I've run on both platforms natively is Borderlands 2
2015-07-07 23:21:47	krosos	then it might be a) your card b) something else or c) i have no idea about cards
2015-07-07 23:22:26	Votato	I think it might be AMD OpenGL support not being up to scratch, I tried OpenGL ETS2 on Windows, performed much poorer than the DX version
2015-07-07 23:23:09	krosos	multilib support?
2015-07-07 23:23:39	GI_Jack	Votato, thats because its lack of freedom

2015-12-13 09:29:00	joshsyn	socks connect your body to the external environment 
2015-12-13 09:29:23	joshsyn	so similarly unix socks allows you to communicate from one process to another

2015-12-13 09:34:10	joshsyn	oh boy, you've got a lot to learn before starting unity on linux
2015-12-13 09:34:27	joshsyn	but you are right in some ways
2015-12-13 09:34:40	blueblur112198	I have already worked with unity before
2015-12-13 09:34:57	joshsyn	essentially there are many ways to do inter process communication
2015-12-13 09:35:10	blueblur112198	ok
2015-12-13 09:35:14	joshsyn	named pipes, i.e mkfifo is just one of them
2015-12-13 09:35:15	blueblur112198	oh wait
2015-12-13 09:35:19	blueblur112198	dbus is one of those right
2015-12-13 09:35:43	blueblur112198	thats why its recommended to run your wm with dbus-launch --exit-with-session
2015-12-13 09:36:03	joshsyn	dbus is much more than just communication
2015-12-13 09:36:11	blueblur112198	yeah I figured
2015-12-13 09:36:26	blueblur112198	it seems to do lots of things
2015-12-13 09:36:26	joshsyn	it includes lots of other non sensical things 
2015-12-13 09:36:35	joshsyn	thats why you run it like a server
2015-12-13 09:36:56	blueblur112198	wait for systemd to replace it

2015-12-13 09:58:54	blueblur112198	having more than one remote access program to remote into a server seems unclean

2015-12-13 10:41:38	evening	after something is observed by time, it is then observed in relation to other objects, which motion

2015-12-13 10:42:22	blueblur112198	hey how about quantum shit now
2015-12-13 10:42:39	blueblur112198	like
2015-12-13 10:42:41	joshsyn	someone once said speed of light is constant every where
2015-12-13 10:42:50	evening	it is not
2015-12-13 10:42:50	blueblur112198	whats the deal with schrodingers box
2015-12-13 10:43:00	joshsyn	wait i'll explain
2015-12-13 10:43:03	evening	light composed of smaller elements.
2015-12-13 10:43:20	evening	also, when Jobs died, they stopped light in a vacuum.
2015-12-13 10:43:40	joshsyn	if you go close to the speed of light others observe you to be travelling slower
2015-12-13 10:43:47	joshsyn	or time runs faster for you
2015-12-13 10:43:56	joshsyn	but the speed of light stays constant
2015-12-13 10:44:47	joshsyn	yup they proved light consists of particles with the photoelectric effect
2015-12-13 10:44:51	joshsyn	by einstein
2015-12-13 10:45:23	joshsyn	but the wave light pattern of double slit experiment is puzzling
2015-12-13 10:46:41	joshsyn	when you fire a photon one by one into a double slit without observation, you get a wave like pattern slowly
2015-12-13 10:47:04	joshsyn	but when you make observation, there is no more wave like pattern 
2015-12-13 10:47:44	joshsyn	so they concluded that photon exists at 2 places at the same time after passing through double slit
2015-12-13 10:48:18	joshsyn	and when its "disturbed" or you make observation or you interact it with the environment
2015-12-13 10:48:35	joshsyn	you collapse that quantum state
2015-12-13 10:48:53	joshsyn	and its seen only at one place
2015-12-13 10:49:00	joshsyn	strange but amazing

2015-12-13 21:12:55	vrmxm	See, when you make a request to x.y.z your computer checks to see if it knows who x.y.z is
2015-12-13 21:13:17	vrmxm	If not, then it sends the traffic to its default gateway (your router)
2015-12-13 21:13:55	vrmxm	Your router apparently knows that *.home is the LAN, but doesn't know who *.google.com is, or *.vpn
2015-12-13 21:14:08	vrmxm	So it sends it down the line to its DNS servers
2015-12-13 21:14:20	vrmxm	Which are OpenDNS or Google DNS or your ISP or whoever
2015-12-13 21:15:17	vrmxm	As I recall, setting up a VPN connection also means that you're setting some static routes on the connected machines so that your machine can resolve ranges of IPs to the VPN

2015-12-13 21:16:40	vrmxm	So if you request a domain like *.vpn, it would need to be resolved to your VPN -before- it leaves the VPN connection point (your local machine, I assume)

2015-12-13 21:19:30	vixus	vrmxm: yes, and OpenVPN allows you to push DNS servers to the clients (with openresolv's help) so that all DNS requests are made to the IPs specified in the VPN server config.
2015-12-13 21:20:02	vrmxm	So to take advantage of that, you'll have to run your own DNS server
2015-12-13 21:20:24	vixus	Yeah. dnsmasq doesn't look too difficult to configure

2015-12-19 23:33:43	vrmxm	Unless you mean _listens_ to it's users
2015-12-19 23:33:45	hekel	exactly
2015-12-19 23:33:49	vrmxm	As in spying
2015-12-19 23:33:53	hekel	no
2015-12-19 23:33:55	 *	hekel sighs
2015-12-19 23:34:08	hekel	I'm trying real hard not to call anyone an asshat today
2015-12-19 23:34:15	vrmxm	You can call me one, it's ok
2015-12-19 23:34:23	vrmxm	My ass hat is made of tin foil.
2015-12-19 23:34:24	vixus	hekel: but you wouldnt use it if it was written in JS, right?
2015-12-19 23:34:25	hekel	no, not in here, I'd get banned
2015-12-19 23:34:53	hekel	vixus, I might try it just to try it, but I doubt I'd stick with a browser written in java anything
2015-12-19 23:36:01	hekel	but yeah, vrmxm someone needs to take the 1 or 2 awesome things about chrome and write another browser 
2015-12-19 23:36:03	john_f	so ecmascript is fine?
2015-12-19 23:36:05	vrmxm	So what's the big idea behind nftables (as opposed to iptables)?
2015-12-19 23:36:24	hekel	it'd be refreshing
2015-12-19 23:36:25	vrmxm	hekel > What awesome things are those?
2015-12-19 23:36:42	vrmxm	All I'm aware of is the per-tab memory/process separation
2015-12-19 23:36:54	vixus	what are the 1 or 2 awesome things about chrome?
2015-12-19 23:37:11	john_f	not 30 years old I guess
2015-12-19 23:37:31	hekel	well #1.. the browser itself doesn't try to troll me anywhere near as much as you people
2015-12-19 23:37:44	vrmxm	Eh?
2015-12-19 23:38:05	vixus	chrome crashes on windows 10 when you try and save a file
2015-12-19 23:38:08	hekel	and its also got the best html5 support
2015-12-19 23:38:14	vixus	hilarious
2015-12-19 23:38:23	hekel	vixus, well that's because it's windows

2016-11-24 20:24:58	earnestly	mpan: Java isn't hard realtime
2016-11-24 20:25:08	mpan	yes, it is.
2016-11-24 20:25:16	mar77i	some point of time is always 42 hours away.
2016-11-24 20:25:23	mpan	At most you can say that Orcale’s JVM isn’t, but it’s not the only VM available.

2016-11-24 20:26:17	mpan	Java is successfully used in hard realtime systems (there is nothing that prevents this). It is also, with greater success than any other language, used in embedded platforms, especially these with low memory and computing power.
2016-11-24 20:26:34	earnestly	mpan: Oh if you want to say you can implement hard realtime in JVM then sure, but even a recent paper on GC'd hard realtime languages show that you're subjecting over 30% of a time slot to GC overhead, just to be consistent
2016-11-24 20:27:20	earnestly	Like most languages, they're usually soft realtime, like Erlang
2016-11-24 20:27:33	+a0	Wat am I doing with my life
2016-11-24 20:27:58	mpan	earnestly: with Oracle’s GC? Sure. Not with any GC, especially designed for RT. And still no one says you have to invoke GC much — depends on a program you write.
2016-11-24 20:28:14	earnestly	mpan: And it seems the libraries you use
2016-11-24 20:28:20	mpan	Yes
2016-11-24 20:28:28	earnestly	mpan: And just how 'embedded' you mean
2016-11-24 20:28:51	mpan	Like sim card in your mobile or your credit card (both are running Java).
2016-11-24 20:29:09	earnestly	mpan: Or Intel's ME
2016-11-24 20:30:36	mpan	GC in RT virtual machines is predictable, doing only so little work to not get over the hard limit.
2016-11-24 20:31:21	vaesper	what do people here use to manage their zsh?
2016-11-24 20:31:48	earnestly	Like I said, you can have a GC in *hard* realtime, it will be predictable, but it will need to suck up a significant amount of the time slot, meaning your program will be slower
2016-11-24 20:32:37	earnestly	A lot of implementations I've read about seem to avoid the GC entirely by preallocating and then managing it themselves with a few drawbacks like scoping issues
2016-11-24 20:32:52	mpan	Seed isn’t priority for RT. But putting this aside, where 30% comes from, especially for systems which have nothing to GC in the first place?

2016-11-24 20:38:27	earnestly	?
2016-11-24 20:38:29	earnestly	What's that
2016-11-24 20:38:29	mpan	Hsqldb? This monster is throwing garbage all over the memory and GC will always be costly for it, but it was never meant to be run in RT environment.
2016-11-24 20:38:47	mpan	earnestly: a virtual machine meant to run RT applications?
2016-11-24 20:39:20	earnestly	mpan: So a RT VM?
2016-11-24 20:39:45	earnestly	mpan: Do you have any papers, articles, documents, etc?
2016-11-24 20:40:12	earnestly	mpan: On GC based languages used in hard realtime systems, soft is fine too I guess (such as erlang)
2016-11-24 20:41:37	earnestly	Or how GC can be made completely predictable
2016-11-24 20:41:37	mpan	No, I’m not working on RT. However search for information on PTRC VM. Also Azul, while not being hard realtime system, provides “by accident” soft realtime features.
2016-11-24 20:41:37	earnestly	I know of Azul
2016-11-24 20:41:37	earnestly	It still uses memory barriers

2016-11-24 20:41:37	mpan	earnestly: and about predictability: the paper you have cited actually describes GC working that way (see: slack-scheduled GC).
2016-11-24 20:42:04	mpan	earnestly: anyway, my statement was about the choice of software for the test, not about VM.

2016-11-24 20:42:39	mpan	Any VM, even the best one tailored for realtime, will have bad results simply because they have tested it with software that is not designed to work well in such scenario.
2016-11-24 20:42:43	earnestly	Sigh
2016-11-24 20:45:08	earnestly	mpan: Anyway, slack isn't predictable
2016-11-24 20:45:08	mpan	As for the VMs, you may also search for what is used now in trading. These are both fast and provide at least soft realtime.
2016-11-24 20:45:08	mpan	Well… it uses the remaining portion of the time. Nothing more.
2016-11-24 20:47:04	earnestly	mpan: Right, it runs when no tasks are running, which is going to be soft realtime systems really

2016-11-24 20:47:04	mpan	Hard, because it may be scheduled to do only so small portion of work it will fit into the time window.
2016-11-24 20:47:04	earnestly	mpan: The alternative is to dedicate a chunk of the time slot to the GC, to let it do some of its work before contining, this is predictable but it does cut into yuor time and generally makes it slower, which is fine
2016-11-24 20:47:04	earnestly	realtime isn't about speed
2016-11-24 20:47:04	earnestly	Which is fine because realtime isn't about speed*
2016-11-24 20:47:04	mpan	I said that already. And haven’t said opposite…
2016-11-24 20:47:20	mpan	Oh, sorry. Didn't noticed your second line is continuation! :D
2016-11-24 20:47:35	earnestly	mpan: I've been talking about hard realtime this /entire/ time, I tried to emphasise it even, but you kept arguing about realtime in general, mostly talking abou soft rt, eugh
2016-11-24 20:47:35	mpan	I’ve read the first one and then, as a separate sentence, the second one.
2016-11-24 20:48:10	earnestly	Anyway, I feel like GCs are a hack
2016-11-24 20:48:21	earnestly	I really with we went more in the direction mlkit tried

2016-11-24 20:48:48	mpan	Let me read about mlkit.
2016-11-24 20:53:08	earnestly	Or even really Ada
2016-11-24 20:53:08	earnestly	But Ada is a bit different, in that it doesn't let you manually deallocate memory without using unchecked functions
2016-11-24 20:53:08	mpan	Never heard about mlkit, but it seems it uses approach I know. But can’t really say it’s simply better than GC.
2016-11-24 20:53:08	earnestly	mpan: You know how tuning GC based programs often involves rewriting code to avoid needing the GC?  This happens a lot in Haskell for example

2016-11-24 20:53:08	earnestly	mpan: lrs does something similar, but in both cases there will be some patterns of code that just do need some kind of persistent heap storage that needs to be managed
2016-11-24 20:53:08	earnestly	And that's the hard thing about it
2016-11-24 20:53:08	earnestly	GC on the other hand, is a quick fix compared to that
2016-11-24 20:53:08	mpan	It requires explicit management of objects ownership, and this is not only ugly, but in modern programming impossible.

2016-11-24 20:53:18	earnestly	I'm refering to the case where you profile the rts to limit the need for a GC to run at all
2016-11-24 20:53:35	earnestly	mpan: Yeah, static allocation at runtime, think of scope, raii, etc.
2016-11-24 20:54:03	mpan	These are inefficient.

2016-11-24 20:54:20	earnestly	._.
2016-11-24 20:54:37	mpan	Also, as I said, they require explicit ownership management, which is inconvenient and/or impossible.
2016-11-24 20:55:19	earnestly	Nevermind mpan, thanks anyway for pointing me at Java's RTSJ
2016-11-24 20:55:23	mpan	This is why GC and management based on escape analysis has been invented in the first place.
2016-11-24 20:55:40	mpan	I mean… no one would do that if RAII would work that well ;).

2016-11-26 08:21:45	paulguy	people expecting a president to actually change anything in any way that actually makes things better

2016-11-26 08:23:56	paulguy	the only way he could bring jobs back to the US en masse would be to basically undo all environmental protections and worker rights.
2016-11-26 08:24:12	+sudokode	the president has two main powers.. sign laws and make executive orders
2016-11-26 08:24:41	+sudokode	usually the president will follow his party's congressman

2016-11-26 08:24:58	+sudokode	which he has a majority now
2016-11-26 08:25:22	+sudokode	pcspkr: cuba was outlawed via congress, so I doubt trump is even necessary
2016-11-26 08:25:46	+sudokode	well, most of cuba. not the gitmo part
2016-11-26 08:26:16	pcspkr	mr. hope and change didn't close gitmo after all

2016-11-26 08:31:32	MrElendig	the thing about trump is that he has support in congress too most likely, unless he *really* pisses off everyone
2016-11-26 08:31:42	MrElendig	which makes him more dangerous/powerfull than what obama is
2016-11-26 08:31:56	paulguy	yeah
2016-11-26 08:32:35	paulguy	the good thing tht came out of obama was not being denied insurance due to previous conditions, although it's barely a bandage over a totally broken system.

2016-11-26 09:39:31	sedrosken	no i think they use rizon too
2016-11-26 09:39:42	sedrosken	i know the /r/pcmasterrace subreddit hangs out on rizon
2016-11-26 09:40:38	conmanworknor	should really change that to linuxmasterrace
2016-11-26 09:40:56	sedrosken	there is a linuxmasterrace subreddit
2016-11-26 09:41:00	conmanworknor	but then the flossmasterrace would take over
2016-11-26 09:41:33	+SolidSaltySwan	r/linuxmasterrace is cringe as fuck

2016-11-26 09:43:25	sedrosken	why not just use mint in that case
2016-11-26 09:43:31	sedrosken	or a competent distro like arch
2016-11-26 09:43:39	conmanworknor	they need graphical installation
2016-11-26 09:43:43	sedrosken	manjaro
2016-11-26 09:44:08	sedrosken	i thought manjaro had a graphical install? or was that antergos
2016-11-26 09:44:18	conmanworknor	yeah antergross

2016-11-26 09:44:27	conmanworknor	probly everything but arch
2016-11-26 09:44:46	sedrosken	i dont mind antergos -- it would have made my first foray into arch much easier if i had known about it
2016-11-26 09:45:01	conmanworknor	fuck no, you would have left after the first CLI command
2016-11-26 09:45:07	sedrosken	or if it existed when i did my first arch install
2016-11-26 09:45:20	+SolidSaltySwan	I think it's a terrible idea to give people a GUI installer for arch and not teach them how to maintain the system
2016-11-26 09:45:33	conmanworknor	what, i have to use CLI to install packages? where is the sfotware center? why dossent mein internet cd werk
2016-11-26 09:45:34	sedrosken	nah, i had been well acquainted with the command line, its just at the time i had no clue what an fstab was for example

2016-11-26 09:46:53	+SolidSaltySwan	those people are probably better off just using Ubuntu instead tbh
2016-11-26 09:46:59	conmanworknor	same for ubuntu, though.
2016-11-26 09:47:05	conmanworknor	you need command line to fix the fucking thing
2016-11-26 09:47:09	sedrosken	the linux club at my college is filled with plebs using ubuntu
2016-11-26 09:47:10	conmanworknor	just make them start with it
2016-11-26 09:47:19	conmanworknor	gotta start somewhere
2016-11-26 09:47:28	conmanworknor	dont stab them too many times
2016-11-26 09:47:33	conmanworknor	s/stab/fstab
2016-11-26 09:47:39	mklein	But with Arch, you learn best by doing. I remember having graphics problems and having a black screen with no cursor on boot trying to get X to work; never learned more about grub/Xorg/etc. than I did then.
2016-11-26 09:47:48	sedrosken	yeah same here
2016-11-26 09:48:01	sedrosken	a lot of what i know about linux i learned by having problems and fixing them
2016-11-26 09:48:29	conmanworknor	yeah thats the main idea. doesn't ubuntu just automount everything, windows style?
2016-11-26 09:48:43	sedrosken	but yeah the linux club is either people using ubuntu, mint, or gentoo elitists who think theyre better than everyone
2016-11-26 09:48:46	sedrosken	i think it does
2016-11-26 09:49:07	sedrosken	and i have arch configured to do the same to removable media -- because i find using mount commands a pain in the ass, not because i dont know how
2016-11-26 09:49:34	+SolidSaltySwan	there's a linux club? :o

2016-11-26 12:31:30	mpan	A feature of systemd.
2016-11-26 12:31:30	paulguy	you have to hit it 7 times within a second?

2016-11-26 12:31:30	paulguy	well either way I was aiming for a proper reboot. :p
2016-11-26 12:31:30	paulguy	not a forced reboot
2016-11-26 12:31:30	mpan	Oh, ok.
2016-11-26 12:31:30	paulguy	if I wanted to force a reboot, there's a button on my computer for that
2016-11-26 12:31:30	mpan	7 times / seconds is, more or less, press ctrl+alt+del as mad… systemd doesn’t really care if you press it more than 7 times.
2016-11-26 12:32:03	paulguy	and usually when it's frozen for me, it's frozen hard.

2016-11-26 13:33:53	+nshp	clang-based source tagging which is actually correct because clang
2016-11-26 13:34:02	+nshp	rather than this fuzzy-parsing nonsense ctags does
2016-11-26 13:34:17	alyptik	gonna try that out
2016-11-26 13:34:30	alyptik	seems interesting
2016-11-26 13:35:04	+nshp	only downsides are: it requires the ability to compile your source with clang, and it can't possibly help with languages other than C/C++
2016-11-26 13:35:23	alyptik	there are no other languages
2016-11-26 13:35:26	+nshp	Perl! >:(

2016-11-26 13:35:50	alyptik	heh
2016-11-26 13:36:12	+nshp	ctags does a decent job at perl most of the time though
2016-11-26 13:36:41	alyptik	i would never be able to look at c++ source without ctags
2016-11-26 13:36:41	+nshp	better than with C in my experience, heh
2016-11-26 13:36:57	alyptik	god just thinking about it makes me want to throw up
2016-11-26 13:37:10	+nshp	well rtags is 10x better for C++ then, because it actually understands C++ rather than blindly guessing
2016-11-26 13:37:18	+nshp	C++ is too hard to parse

2016-11-26 14:25:21	+phillid	man 7 ascii probably has to never change because some shitty software probably relies on it being the way it is
2016-11-26 14:25:37	alyptik	most likely
2016-11-26 14:25:50	+phillid	Kinda like the shakeup when perl's hash ordering became randomised

2016-11-26 14:29:24	+nshp	and it's actually noticeably faster than with gcc
2016-11-26 14:29:28	alyptik	i heard -Ofast was not a good idea
2016-11-26 14:29:32	alyptik	not 100% on what it does
2016-11-26 14:29:32	+nshp	*shrug*

2016-11-26 14:33:46	+nshp	that's what -xHost is iirc, but I'm compiling on my workstation for my laptop, so I don't want that
2016-11-26 14:33:46	alyptik	native doesn't work for distcc
2016-11-26 14:33:46	alyptik	it gets all confungled

2016-11-26 18:28:13	SporkWitch	^
2016-11-26 18:28:27	alyptik	doesn't do much afaik, you mostly die from no oxygen/trauma if you are dumb and have a full lungfull of air
2016-11-26 18:28:29	NextHendrix	expansion probably would
2016-11-26 18:28:38	alyptik	yeah the expansion would fuck you up
2016-11-26 18:28:57	SporkWitch	hence not holding your breath

2016-11-26 18:29:58	SporkWitch	but that's not exactly a show you hold to scientific rigor lol
2016-11-26 18:30:00	alyptik	and wtf at the earplugs
2016-11-26 18:30:07	alyptik	indeed
2016-11-26 18:30:32	SporkWitch	star trek, on the other hand, at least TRIES to seem plausible, and with established stuff it usually doesn't just make things up like it does everything else

2016-11-26 18:30:47	SporkWitch	it honestly surprised me, i mean, did they not have even a single scuba diver on the team to tell them NOT to hold their breath? 
2016-11-26 18:31:16	SporkWitch	(i only notice it becaues I've been rewatching TNG, and in one of the episodes Geordi and Dr. Crusher have to decompress the cargo bay and they say to hold their breaths lol)

2016-11-27 09:32:23	Kirito	f2fs still seems dubious
2016-11-27 09:32:24	+alyptik	Kirito: use xfs
2016-11-27 09:32:34	Kirito	Which is probably why no one uses it yet
2016-11-27 09:32:37	+alyptik	super stable 
2016-11-27 09:33:07	+alyptik	I use it on all my flash nowadays
2016-11-27 09:33:29	Kirito	Xfs might actually not be a bad idea. I don't really know how it compares with ext4 on flash memory, but it's still probably superior
2016-11-27 09:33:36	+alyptik	haven't lost any data yet over a year
2016-11-27 09:33:55	Kirito	I use xfs on all my Linux boxes now, server and personal :D

2016-11-27 09:34:18	zphinx	any particular reason for a home user to use it over ext4?

2016-11-27 09:34:25	+alyptik	ext4 still corrupts at times for me
2016-11-27 09:34:32	Kirito	f2fs is supposed to be specifically optimized for flash memory though
2016-11-27 09:34:34	zphinx	never ever had a problem with ext4
2016-11-27 09:35:54	sedrosken	ive never had a single problem with ext4

2016-11-27 09:35:55	sedrosken	or ext3, or even 2 for that matter
2016-11-27 09:35:55	+alyptik	if you dont ext4 is fine
2016-11-27 09:35:55	krae	how can it corrupt with journaling
2016-11-27 09:35:55	+alyptik	unno
2016-11-27 09:35:55	+alyptik	it just did
2016-11-27 09:35:55	Kirito	I've had btrfs fsck my data once it twice before
2016-11-27 09:35:55	+alyptik	mid write maybe?
2016-11-27 09:35:55	Kirito	That was a long time ago though
2016-11-27 09:35:55	zphinx	i mean, i understand that a buiness or institution would use a filesystem that has more features with regards to protecting data integrity and easy backups
2016-11-27 09:35:55	krae	when it does journaling, it shouldn't matter
2016-11-27 09:35:55	zphinx	but do most home users need that shit?
2016-11-27 09:35:56	+alyptik	ny computer just sux prob
2016-11-27 09:36:06	Kirito	ext4 could fuck your data with the trim bug on some SSDs
2016-11-27 09:36:21	zphinx	s/data/pornfolder
2016-11-27 09:36:33	+alyptik	its faster than ext4 for me too at least
2016-11-27 09:36:34	Kirito	That's probably not at all specific to ext4 though I'm guessing
2016-11-27 09:36:40	+alyptik	i use it for my music lib
2016-11-27 09:37:24	Kirito	I've never had problems with ext4 specifically that I can remember
2016-11-27 09:37:37	sedrosken	well, maybe next time i do a reinstall ill check it out
2016-11-27 09:38:00	+alyptik	barely any xruns compared to ext4 for some reason
2016-11-27 09:38:01	zphinx	but tbh

2016-11-27 09:38:28	Kirito	XFS can significantly outperform ext4 almost across the board though
2016-11-27 09:38:40	Kirito	While still providing more features
